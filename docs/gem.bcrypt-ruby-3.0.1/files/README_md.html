# bcrypt-ruby
</p>
<p>
An easy way to keep your users&#8217; passwords secure.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## Why you should use `bcrypt()`
</p>
<p>
If you store user passwords in the clear, then an attacker who steals a
copy of your database has a giant list of emails and passwords. Some of
your users will only have one password &#8212; for their email account, for
their banking account, for your application. A simple hack could escalate
into massive identity theft.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s your responsibility as a web developer to make your web
application secure &#8212; blaming your users for not being security
experts is not a professional response to risk.
</p>
<p>
`bcrypt()` allows you to easily harden your application against these kinds
of attacks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: JRuby versions of bcrypt-ruby `<= 2.1.3` had a [security
vulnerability](<a
href="http://www.mindrot.org/files/jBCrypt/internat.adv">www.mindrot.org/files/jBCrypt/internat.adv</a>)
that was fixed in `>= 2.1.4`. If you used a vulnerable version to hash
passwords with international characters in them, you will need to re-hash
those passwords. This vulernability only affected the JRuby gem.
</p>
<p>
## How to install bcrypt
</p>
<pre>
    sudo gem install bcrypt-ruby
</pre>
<p>
The bcrypt-ruby gem is available on the following ruby platforms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>JRuby

</li>
<li>RubyInstaller 1.8 and 1.9 builds on win32

</li>
<li>Any 1.8 or 1.9 ruby on a BSD/OSX/Linux system with a compiler

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## How to use `bcrypt()` in your Rails application
</p>
<p>
### The <em>User</em> model
</p>
<pre>
    require 'bcrypt'

    class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      # users.password_hash in the database is a :string
      include BCrypt

      def password
        @password ||= Password.new(password_hash)
      end

      def password=(new_password)
        @password = Password.create(new_password)
        self.password_hash = @password
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
### Creating an account
</p>
<pre>
    def create
      @user = User.new(params[:user])
      @user.password = params[:password]
      @user.save!
    end
</pre>
<p>
### Authenticating a user
</p>
<pre>
    def login
      @user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
      if @user.password == params[:password]
        give_token
      else
        redirect_to home_url
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
### If a user forgets their password?
</p>
<pre>
    # assign them a random one and mail it to them, asking them to change it
    def forgot_password
      @user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
      random_password = Array.new(10).map { (65 + rand(58)).chr }.join
      @user.password = random_password
      @user.save!
      Mailer.create_and_deliver_password_change(@user, random_password)
    end
</pre>
<p>
## How to use bcrypt-ruby in general
</p>
<pre>
    require 'bcrypt'

    my_password = BCrypt::Password.create(&quot;my password&quot;)
      #=&gt; &quot;$2a$10$vI8aWBnW3fID.ZQ4/zo1G.q1lRps.9cGLcZEiGDMVr5yUP1KUOYTa&quot;

    my_password.version              #=&gt; &quot;2a&quot;
    my_password.cost                 #=&gt; 10
    my_password == &quot;my password&quot;     #=&gt; true
    my_password == &quot;not my password&quot; #=&gt; false

    my_password = BCrypt::Password.new(&quot;$2a$10$vI8aWBnW3fID.ZQ4/zo1G.q1lRps.9cGLcZEiGDMVr5yUP1KUOYTa&quot;)
    my_password == &quot;my password&quot;     #=&gt; true
    my_password == &quot;not my password&quot; #=&gt; false
</pre>

<p>
## How `bcrypt()` works
</p>
<p>
`bcrypt()` is a hashing algorithm designed by Niels Provos and David
Mazières of the OpenBSD Project.
</p>
<p>
### Background
</p>
<p>
Hash algorithms take a chunk of data (e.g., your user&#8217;s password) and
create a &#8220;digital fingerprint,&#8221; or hash, of it. Because this
process is not reversible, there&#8217;s no way to go from the hash back to
the password.
</p>
<p>
In other words:
</p>
<pre>
    hash(p) #=&gt; &lt;unique gibberish&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You can store the hash and check it against a hash made of a potentially
valid password:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;unique gibberish&gt; =? hash(just_entered_password)
</pre>
<p>
### Rainbow Tables
</p>
<p>
But even this has weaknesses &#8212; attackers can just run lists of
possible passwords through the same algorithm, store the results in a big
database, and then look up the passwords by their hash:
</p>
<pre>
    PrecomputedPassword.find_by_hash(&lt;unique gibberish&gt;).password #=&gt; &quot;secret1&quot;
</pre>
<p>
### Salts
</p>
<p>
The solution to this is to add a small chunk of random data &#8212; called
a salt &#8212; to the password before it&#8217;s hashed:
</p>
<pre>
    hash(salt + p) #=&gt; &lt;really unique gibberish&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The salt is then stored along with the hash in the database, and used to
check potentially valid passwords:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;really unique gibberish&gt; =? hash(salt + just_entered_password)
</pre>
<p>
bcrypt-ruby automatically handles the storage and generation of these salts
for you.
</p>
<p>
Adding a salt means that an attacker has to have a gigantic database for
each unique salt &#8212; for a salt made of 4 letters, that&#8217;s 456,976
different databases. Pretty much no one has that much storage space, so
attackers try a different, slower method &#8212; throw a list of potential
passwords at each individual password:
</p>
<pre>
    hash(salt + &quot;aadvark&quot;) =? &lt;really unique gibberish&gt;
    hash(salt + &quot;abacus&quot;)  =? &lt;really unique gibberish&gt;
    etc.
</pre>
<p>
This is much slower than the big database approach, but most hash
algorithms are pretty quick &#8212; and therein lies the problem. Hash
algorithms aren&#8217;t usually designed to be slow, they&#8217;re designed
to turn gigabytes of data into secure fingerprints as quickly as possible.
`bcrypt()`, though, is designed to be computationally expensive:
</p>
<pre>
    Ten thousand iterations:
                 user     system      total        real
    md5      0.070000   0.000000   0.070000 (  0.070415)
    bcrypt  22.230000   0.080000  22.310000 ( 22.493822)
</pre>
<p>
If an attacker was using Ruby to check each password, they could check
~140,000 passwords a second with MD5 but only ~450 passwords a second with
`bcrypt()`.
</p>
<p>
### Cost Factors
</p>
<p>
In addition, `bcrypt()` allows you to increase the amount of work required
to hash a password as computers get faster. Old passwords will still work
fine, but new passwords can keep up with the times.
</p>
<p>
The default cost factor used by bcrypt-ruby is 10, which is fine for
session-based authentication. If you are using a stateless authentication
architecture (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth), you will want to lower the cost
factor to reduce your server load and keep your request times down. This
will lower the security provided you, but there are few alternatives.
</p>
<p>
## More Information
</p>
<p>
`bcrypt()` is currently used as the default password storage hash in
OpenBSD, widely regarded as the most secure operating system available.
