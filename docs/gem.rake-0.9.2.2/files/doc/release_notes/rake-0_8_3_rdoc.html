        <h1>Rake 0.8.3 Released</h1>
<p>
Rake version 0.8.3 is a bug-fix release of rake.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<h3>Bug Fixes in Version 0.8.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced the system directory detection in windows. We now check
HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH and USERPROFILE if APPDATA isn&#8217;t found. (Patch
supplied by James Tucker). Rake no long aborts if it can&#8217;t find the
directory.

</li>
<li>Added fix to handle ruby installations in directories with spaces in their
name.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Rake</h2>
<p>
Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But instead
of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to declare tasks and
dependencies. You have the full power of a modern scripting language built
right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">Home Page:</td><td><a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake.rubyforge.org/</a>

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Download:</td><td><a
href="http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50">rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50</a>

</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Task Argument Examples</h2>
<p>
Prior to version 0.8.0, rake was only able to handle command line arguments
of the form NAME=VALUE that were passed into Rake via the ENV hash. Many
folks had asked for some kind of simple command line arguments, perhaps
using &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; to separate regular task names from argument
values on the command line. The problem is that there was no easy way to
associate positional arguments on the command line with different tasks.
Suppose both tasks :a and :b expect a command line argument: does the first
value go with :a? What if :b is run first? Should it then get the first
command line argument.
</p>
<p>
Rake 0.8.0 solves this problem by explicitly passing values directly to the
tasks that need them. For example, if I had a release task that required a
version number, I could say:
</p>
<pre>
   rake release[0.8.3]
</pre>
<p>
And the string &#8220;0.8.3&#8220; will be passed to the :release task.
Multiple arguments can be passed by separating them with a comma, for
example:
</p>
<pre>
   rake name[john,doe]
</pre>
<p>
Just a few words of caution. The rake task name and its arguments need to
be a single command line argument to rake. This generally means no spaces.
If spaces are needed, then the entire rake + argument string should be
quoted. Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
   rake &quot;name[billy bob, smith]&quot;
</pre>
<p>
(Quoting rules vary between operating systems and shells, so make sure you
consult the proper docs for your OS/shell).
</p>
<h3>Tasks that Expect Parameters</h3>
<p>
Parameters are only given to tasks that are setup to expect them. In order
to handle named parameters, the task declaration syntax for tasks has been
extended slightly.
</p>
<p>
For example, a task that needs a first name and last name might be declared
as:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, :first_name, :last_name
</pre>
<p>
The first argument is still the name of the task (:name in this case). The
next to argumements are the names of the parameters expected by :name
(:first_name and :last_name in the example).
</p>
<p>
To access the values of the paramters, the block defining the task
behaviour can now accept a second parameter:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, :first_name, :last_name do |t, args|
     puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;
     puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;
   end
</pre>
<p>
The first argument of the block &#8220;t&#8221; is always bound to the
current task object. The second argument &#8220;args&#8221; is an
open-struct like object that allows access to the task arguments. Extra
command line arguments to a task are ignored. Missing command line
arguments are given the nil value.
</p>
