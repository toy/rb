<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> 2 is written with sugar,
spice and everything nice
</p>
<h6>======================================================</h6>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> is Ruby library for
Markdown processing that smells like butterflies and popcorn.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> used to be a drop-in
replacement for Redcloth. This is no longer the case since version 2
&#8212; it now has its own API, but retains the old name. Yes, that does
mean that <a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> 2 is not
backwards-compatible with the 1.X versions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> is powered by the Sundown
library, which can be found at
</p>
<pre>
    https://www.github.com/tanoku/sundown
</pre>
<p>
You might want to find out more about Sundown to see what makes this Ruby
library so awesome.
</p>
<p>
This library is written by people
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> 2 has been rewritten from
scratch by Vicent Martí (@tanoku). Why are you not following me on
Twitter?
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> would not be possible
without the Sundown library and its authors (Natacha Porté, Vicent Martí,
and its many awesome contributors).
</p>
<p>
You can totally install it as a Gem
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> is readily available as a
Ruby gem. It will build some native extensions, but the parser is
standalone and requires no installed libraries.
</p>
<pre>
    $ [sudo] gem install redcarpet
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> source (including
Sundown as a submodule) is available at GitHub:
</p>
<pre>
    $ git clone git://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet.git
</pre>
<p>
And it&#8217;s like <b>really</b> simple to use
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
The core of the <a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> library
is the `Redcarpet::Markdown` class. Each instance of the class is attached
to a `Renderer` object; the Markdown class performs parsing of a document
and uses the attached renderer to generate output.
</p>
<p>
The `Markdown` object is encouraged to be instantiated once with the
required settings, and reused between parses.
</p>
<pre>
    Markdown.new(renderer, extensions={})

    Initializes a Markdown parser

    renderer -  a renderer object, inheriting from Redcarpet::Render::Base.
                If the given object has not been instantiated, the library
                will do it with default arguments.

    extensions - a hash containing the Markdown extensions which the parser
                will identify. The following extensions are accepted:

                :no_intra_emphasis - do not parse emphasis inside of words.
                    Strings such as `foo_bar_baz` will not generate `&lt;em&gt;`
                    tags.

                :tables - parse tables, PHP-Markdown style

                :fenced_code_blocks - parse fenced code blocks, PHP-Markdown
                    style. Blocks delimited with 3 or more `~` or backticks
                    will be considered as code, without the need to be
                    indented. An optional language name may be added at the
                    end of the opening fence for the code block

                :autolink - parse links even when they are not enclosed in
                    `&lt;&gt;` characters. Autolinks for the http, https and ftp
                    protocols will be automatically detected. Email addresses
                    are also handled, and http links without protocol, but
                    starting with `www.`

                :strikethrough - parse strikethrough, PHP-Markdown style
                    Two `~` characters mark the start of a strikethrough,
                    e.g. `this is ~~good~~ bad`

                :lax_html_blocks - HTML blocks do not require to be surrounded
                    by an empty line as in the Markdown standard.

                :space_after_headers - A space is always required between the
                    hash at the beginning of a header and its name, e.g.
                    `#this is my header` would not be a valid header.

                :superscript - parse superscripts after the `^` character;
                    contiguous superscripts are nested together, and complex
                    values can be enclosed in parenthesis,
                    e.g. `this is the 2^(nd) time`

    Example:

        markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML,
            :autolink =&gt; true, :space_after_headers =&gt; true)
</pre>
<p>
Rendering with the `Markdown` object is done through `Markdown#render`.
Unlike in the RedCloth API, the text to render is passed as an argument and
not stored inside the `Markdown` instance, to encourage reusability.
</p>
<pre>
    Markdown.render(text)

    Render a Markdown document with the attached renderer

    text - a Markdown document

    Example:

        markdown.render(&quot;This is *bongos*, indeed.&quot;)
        #=&gt; &quot;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;bongos&lt;/em&gt;, indeed&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Darling, I packed you a couple renderers for lunch
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> comes with two built-in
renderers, `Redcarpet::Render::HTML` and `Redcarpet::Render::XHTML`, which
output HTML and XHTML, respectively. These renderers are actually
implemented in C, and hence offer a brilliant performance, several degrees
of magnitude faster than other Ruby Markdown solutions.
</p>
<p>
All the rendering flags that previously applied only to HTML output have
now been moved to the `Render::HTML` class, and may be enabled when
instantiating the renderer:
</p>
<pre>
    Render::HTML.new(render_options={})

    Initializes an HTML renderer. The following flags are available:

        :filter_html - do not allow any user-inputted HTML in the output

        :no_images - do not generate any `&lt;img&gt;` tags

        :no_links - do not generate any `&lt;a&gt;` tags

        :no_styles - do not generate any `&lt;style&gt;` tags

        :safe_links_only - only generate links for protocols which are considered safe

        :with_toc_data - add HTML anchors to each header in the output HTML,
            to allow linking to each section.

        :hard_wrap - insert HTML `&lt;br&gt;` tags inside on paragraphs where the origin
            Markdown document had newlines (by default, Markdown ignores these
            newlines).

        :xhtml - output XHTML-conformant tags. This option is always enabled in the
            `Render::XHTML` renderer.

    Example:

        rndr = Redcarpet::Render::HTML.new(:no_links =&gt; true, :hard_wrap =&gt; true)
</pre>
<p>
The `HTML` renderer has an alternate version,
`Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC`, which will output a table of contents in
HTML based on the headers of the Markdown document.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the abstract base class `Redcarpet::Render::Base` can be used
to write a custom renderer purely in Ruby, or extending an existing
renderer. See the following section for more information.
</p>
<p>
And you can even cook your own
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
Custom renderers are created by inheriting from an existing renderer. The
built-in renderers, `HTML` and `XHTML` may be extended as such:
</p>
<p>
~~~~~ ruby # create a custom renderer that allows highlighting of code
blocks class HTMLwithAlbino < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
</p>
<pre>
  def block_code(code, language)
    Albino.safe_colorize(code, language)
  end
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<p>
markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(HTMLwithAlbino, :fenced_code_blocks =>
true) ~~~~~
</p>
<p>
But new renderers can also be created from scratch (see `lib/render_man.rb`
for an example implementation of a Manpage renderer)
</p>
<p>
~~~~~~ ruby class ManPage < Redcarpet::Render::Base
</p>
<pre>
    # you get the drill -- keep going from here
</pre>
<p>
end ~~~~~
</p>
<p>
The following instance methods may be implemented by the renderer:
</p>
<pre>
    # Block-level calls
    # If the return value of the method is `nil`, the block
    # will be skipped.
    # If the method for a document element is not implemented,
    # the block will be skipped.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   class RenderWithoutCode &lt; Redcarpet::Render::HTML
    #     def block_code(code, language)
    #       nil
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    block_code(code, language)
    block_quote(quote)
    block_html(raw_html)
    header(text, header_level)
    hrule()
    list(contents, list_type)
    list_item(text, list_type)
    paragraph(text)
    table(header, body)
    table_row(content)
    table_cell(content, alignment)

    # Span-level calls
    # A return value of `nil` will not output any data
    # If the method for a document element is not implemented,
    # the contents of the span will be copied verbatim
    autolink(link, link_type)
    codespan(code)
    double_emphasis(text)
    emphasis(text)
    image(link, title, alt_text)
    linebreak()
    link(link, title, content)
    raw_html(raw_html)
    triple_emphasis(text)
    strikethrough(text)
    superscript(text)

    # Low level rendering
    entity(text)
    normal_text(text)

    # Header of the document
    # Rendered before any another elements
    doc_header()

    # Footer of the document
    # Rendered after all the other elements
    doc_footer()

    # Pre/post-process
    # Special callback: preprocess or postprocess the whole
    # document before or after the rendering process begins
    preprocess(full_document)
    postprocess(full_document)
</pre>
<p>
Also, now our Pants are much smarter
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
<a href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> 2 comes with a standalone
[SmartyPants]( <a
href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/</a>)
implementation. It is fully compliant with the original implementation. It
is the fastest SmartyPants parser there is, with a difference of several
orders of magnitude.
</p>
<p>
The SmartyPants parser can be found in `Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants`. It
has been implemented as a module, so it can be used standalone or as a
mixin.
</p>
<p>
When mixed with a Renderer class, it will override the `postprocess` method
to perform SmartyPants replacements once the rendering is complete
</p>
<p>
~~~~ ruby # Mixin class HTMLWithPants < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
</p>
<pre>
  include Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<p>
# Standalone <a
href="../classes/Redcarpet/Render/SmartyPants.html#M000012">Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants.render</a>(&#8220;<p>Oh
SmartyPants, you&#8217;re so crazy...</p>&#8221;) ~~~~~
</p>
<p>
SmartyPants works on top of already-rendered HTML, and will ignore
replacements inside the content of HTML tags and inside specific HTML
blocks such as `<code>` or `<pre>`.
</p>
<p>
What? You really want to mix Markdown renderers?
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
What a terrible idea! Markdown is already ill-specified enough; if you
create software that is renderer-independent, the results will be
completely unreliable!
</p>
<p>
Each renderer has its own API and its own set of extensions: you should
choose one (it doesn&#8217;t have to be <a
href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a>, though that would be
great!), write your software accordingly, and force your users to install
it. That&#8217;s the only way to have reliable and predictable Markdown
output on your program.
</p>
<p>
Still, if major forces (let&#8217;s say, tornadoes or other natural
disasters) force you to keep a Markdown-compatibility later, <a
href="../classes/Redcarpet.html">Redcarpet</a> also supports this:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'redcarpet/compat'
</pre>
<p>
Requiring the compatibility library will declare a `Markdown` class with
the classical RedCloth API, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
    Markdown.new('this is my text').to_html
</pre>
<p>
This class renders 100% standards compliant Markdown with 0 extensions.
Nada. Don&#8217;t even try to enable extensions with a compatibility layer,
because that&#8217;s a maintance nightmare and won&#8217;t work.
</p>
<p>
On a related topic: if your Markdown gem has a `lib/markdown.rb` file that
monkeypatches the Markdown class, you&#8217;re a terrible human being. Just
saying.
