<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Launchy.html">Launchy</a> is helper class for launching
cross-platform applications in a fire and forget manner.
</p>
<p>
There are application concepts (browser, email client, etc) that are common
across all platforms, and they may be launched differently on each
platform. <a href="../classes/Launchy.html">Launchy</a> is here to make a
common approach to launching external application from within ruby
programs.
</p>
<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<p>
Currently only launching a browser is supported.
</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>
You can use launchy on the commandline, or via its API.
</p>
<h3>Commandline</h3>
<pre>
    % launchy http://www.ruby-lang.org/
</pre>
<p>
There are additional commandline options, use &#8216;launchy
&#8212;help&#8217; to see them.
</p>
<h3>Public API</h3>
<p>
In the vein of <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>,
starting with version 2.0.0, this is the sole supported public API.
</p>
<pre>
    Launchy.open( uri, options = {} )
</pre>
<p>
At the moment, the only available options are:
</p>
<pre>
    :debug        Turn on debugging output
    :application  Explicitly state what application class is going to be used
    :host_os      Explicitly state what host operating system to pretend to be
    :ruby_engine  Explicitly state what ruby engine to pretend to be under
    :dry_run      Do nothing and print the command that would be executed on $stdout
</pre>
<p>
An example of using the public API:
</p>
<pre>
    Launchy.open( &quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot; )
</pre>
<h2>UPGRADING</h2>
<p>
The previously published version of <a
href="../classes/Launchy.html">Launchy</a> was 0.4.0. There have been so
many changes, and a mistaken tag at 1.0.0, that I have decided to bump all
the way to 2.0.x.
</p>
<p>
I have attempted to keep backward compatibility with the previous examples.
The previous API examples of:
</p>
<pre>
    Launchy::Browser.run(&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>
<pre>
    Launchy::Browser.new.visit(&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
will still work, and you will get a deprecation notice, along with the line
of code you should probably update. For example, this is what would print
out in the github gem if it was updated to use 2.0.x but not use the
supported API.

    WARNING: You made a call to a deprecated Launchy API. This call should be changed to 'Launchy.open( uri )'
    WARNING: I think I was able to find the location that needs to be fixed. Please go look at:
