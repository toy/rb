</pre>

 * Version can now be set explicitly on the gemspec, rather than relying on a VERSION file
 * Rubyforge and Gemcutter support now hooks into `rake release`
 * `rake build` now uses an in-memory copy of the gemspec, rather than the filesystem persisted one
 * Rubyforge support no longer forces the uploading of documentation
 * Generator:

# jeweler 0.11.0 2009-04-05
</p>

 * generator will respect JEWELER_OPTS, as a way to provide default options
 (pat-maddox)
 * Include 'examples' and 'rails' directories by default in gemspec files
 * generated gemspec now will only include files (not directories). also, they are listed one per line, and sorted.
 * Jeweler::Tasks's intializer has been improved:
  * You can now pass it an existing gemspec (othewise a new one will be created)
  * Jeweler sets its defaults before yielding the gemspec to you. This allows you to append to its defaults, so you aren't forced to entirely overwrite them just to add one value.
 * Managing a gemspec's files, test_files, and extra_rdoc_files is now more flexible. They are now wrapped in a FileList, so you can easily 'include' or 'exclude' patterns.
