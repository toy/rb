<p>
The NDC class implements a copy of the Nested Diagnostic Context, which is
part of the Apache Log4j library. Nested Diagnostic Contexts were derived
from Neil Harrison&#8217;s article on &#8220;Patterns for Logging
Diagnostic Messages&#8221;, part of the book &#8220;Pattern Languages of
Program Design 3&#8221; edited by Martin et al.
</p>
<p>
NDCs in <a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> are thread safe.
</p>
<p>
NDCs in log4r are close enough to NDCs in Log4j that I include its
documentation directly:
</p>
<p>
&#8230; A Nested Diagnostic Context, or NDC in short, is an instrument to
distinguish interleaved log output from different sources. Log output is
typically interleaved when a server handles multiple clients
near-simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Interleaved log output can still be meaningful if each log entry from
different contexts had a distinctive stamp. This is where NDCs come into
play.
</p>
<p>
Note that NDCs are managed on a per thread basis. NDC operations such as
push, pop(), clear(), getDepth() and setMaxDepth(int) affect the NDC of the
current thread only. NDCs of other threads remain unaffected. &#8230;
</p>
<p>
An important difference between NDCs in <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> vs Log4j is that you do not
have to called NDC.remove() when exiting a thread.
</p>
<p>
This class will automatically create Thread specific storage for the
current thread on the first call to any of its methods, i.e.
</p>
<pre>
  NDC.push( &quot;client accept&quot; );
</pre>
<p>
New threads may inherit the NDC of the parent thread by making use of the
clone_stack() and inherit() methods. By default, the NDC is not inherited
automatically. This is unlike MDCs, which will inherit from the main
thread.
