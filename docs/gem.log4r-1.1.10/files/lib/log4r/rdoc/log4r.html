        <h1>#{version} <a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> API Reference</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the <a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> API
reference. There are two classes of reference, the file overview and the
class API. They are listed under Files and Classes respectively. File
overviews cover the use of the <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> API and some implementation
details, whereas class APIs detail the methods available to the various
objects.
</p>
<p>
The code examples in this API assume:
</p>
<pre>
  include Log4r
</pre>
<p>
This file overview covers some of the major concepts in <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a>.
</p>
<h2>Log Levels</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> provides as many levels
of logging as desired. Logging levels are an ordered set of names ranked by
priority. The more important a level is, the higher its priority and the
more likely we want to see any data associated with it. <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> provides many ways to
filter information by level.
</p>
<p>
Loggers and Outputters have a level parameter which serves as a level
threshold. Any data below this threshold will be ignored by the Logger or
Outputter. Additionally, Outputters can be set to mask out any particular
level or collection of levels.
</p>
<p>
By combining level thresholds with other <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> features, one can direct
any set of data to any destination desired in a way that is easy to
visualize and configure.
</p>
<h3>Default Levels</h3>
<p>
The default log levels and their priority rankings are:
</p>
<pre>
  DEBUG &lt; INFO &lt; WARN &lt; ERROR &lt; FATAL
</pre>
<h3>Custom Levels</h3>
<p>
You can have as many levels as you desire, with any naming scheme. <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> will automatically define
level constants and log method names after your custom specification.
</p>
<p>
Please see log4r/configurator.rb for details.
</p>
<h3>Boundary Levels</h3>
<p>
There are two special levels, <tt>ALL</tt> and <tt>OFF</tt> which denote
whether we are logging at all levels or at none. The priority ranks with
respect to the logging levels are as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  ALL &lt; logging levels as defined by user &lt; OFF
</pre>
<p>
Thus, setting the level to <tt>ALL</tt> will enable logging at all levels
whereas <tt>OFF</tt> will turn off logging completely.
</p>

<h2>Principal Classes of <a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../../classes/Log4r/Logger.html">Log4r::Logger</a> -
Interface to logging

</li>
<li><a href="../../../../classes/Log4r/Outputter.html">Log4r::Outputter</a> -
An output destination for a logger.

</li>
<li><a href="../../../../classes/Log4r/Formatter.html">Log4r::Formatter</a> - A
means of formatting log data.

</li>
<li><a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r/Configurator.html">Log4r::Configurator</a>
- A means of configuring <a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Convenience Classes</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> provides several
convenience Outputters and Formatters. Please look at the file overviews of
those classes for more details.
</p>
<h2>Remote Logging</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> provides a way to send
log events over a network. See log4r/logserver.rb for details.
</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Going on Inside?</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Log4r.html">Log4r</a> has an internal logger
which records much of what goes on inside. To see the output, define a
Logger named &#8216;log4r&#8217; and give it an Outputter of some sort. It
logs only at the lowest and highest priorities. That would be DEBUG and
FATAL for the standard setup.
</p>
<p>
It is essential to view this data when using certain classes, like <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r/LogServer.html">Log4r::LogServer</a> and <a
href="../../../../classes/Log4r/EmailOutputter.html">Log4r::EmailOutputter</a>.
