 = NDC

 The NDC class implements a copy of the Nested Diagnostic Context, which
 is part of the Apache Log4j library.  Nested Diagnostic Contexts were
 derived from Neil Harrison's article on &quot;Patterns for Logging
 Diagnostic Messages&quot;, part of the book &quot;Pattern Languages of Program
 Design 3&quot; edited by Martin et al.

 NDCs in Log4r are thread safe.

 NDCs in log4r are close enough to NDCs in Log4j that I include its
 documentation directly:

 ...
 A Nested Diagnostic Context, or NDC in short, is an instrument to
 distinguish interleaved log output from different sources. Log output
 is typically interleaved when a server handles multiple clients
 near-simultaneously.

 Interleaved log output can still be meaningful if each log entry from
 different contexts had a distinctive stamp. This is where NDCs come into
 play.

 Note that NDCs are managed on a per thread basis. NDC operations such as
 push, pop(), clear(), getDepth() and setMaxDepth(int) affect the NDC of
 the current thread only. NDCs of other threads remain unaffected.
 ...

 An important difference between NDCs in Log4r vs Log4j is that you
 do not have to called NDC.remove() when exiting a thread.

 This class will automatically create Thread specific storage for the
 current thread on the first call to any of its methods, i.e.

   NDC.push( &quot;client accept&quot; );

 New threads may inherit the NDC of the parent thread by making use of
 the clone_stack() and inherit() methods.  By default, the NDC is not
 inherited automatically.  This is unlike MDCs, which will inherit from
 the main thread.
