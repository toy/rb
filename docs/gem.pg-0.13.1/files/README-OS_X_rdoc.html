        <h1>Compiling on MacOS X</h1>
<p>
The EnterpriseDB packages are the recommended PostgreSQL installations to
use with MacOS X. They eliminate most or all of the issues with getting
&#8216;pg&#8217; installed, linked correctly, and running.
</p>
<h2>Segfaults and SSL Support</h2>
<p>
If you need a custom installation of PostgreSQL, you should ensure that you
either compile it against the same version of OpenSSL as the OpenSSL
extension of the Ruby you&#8217;ll be using, or compile it without SSL
support. If you fail to do this, you will likely see segfaults when you use
&#8216;pg&#8217; and the &#8216;openssl&#8217; extension at the same time.
You can see what library it&#8217;s linked against using &#8216;otool
-L&#8217;; for example, on my 10.7 machine I use for &#8216;pg&#8217;
development:
</p>
<pre>
    $ otool -L /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions\
      /1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin11.0/openssl.bundle

    /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/\
        lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin11.0/openssl.bundle:
        /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/\
            usr/lib/libruby.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.8.0, \
            current version 1.8.7)
        /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib (compatibility version 0.9.8, \
            current version 0.9.8)
        /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.8.dylib (compatibility version 0.9.8, \
            current version 0.9.8)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, \
            current version 159.0.0)
</pre>
<h2>Dealing with Installation Problems</h2>
<p>
If you are building/installing pg on MacOS X, and the installation
doesn&#8217;t work at first, here are a few things you can try.
</p>
<h3>pg_config</h3>
<p>
The first thing you should do is ensure that the &#8216;pg_config&#8217;
tool that comes with Postgres is in your path. If it isn&#8217;t, or the
one that&#8217;s first in your path isn&#8217;t the one that was installed
with the Postgres you want to build against, you can specify the path to it
with the &#8212;with-pg-config option.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you&#8217;re using the Ruby binary that comes with OSX, and
PostgreSQL 9.0.x installed from MacPorts, do:
</p>
<pre>
        gem install -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql90/bin/pg_config
</pre>
<h3>ARCHFLAGS and Universal Binaries</h3>
<p>
OS X supports both architecture-specific binaries (e.g. i386), as well as
universal binaries (i.e. i386 &amp; ppc). If Ruby is built as a universal
binary and PostgreSQL is not, you need to specify the path to the
appropriate pg_config binary or set the environment variable ARCHFLAGS
appropriately.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if the build system can&#8217;t figure out which
architectures it should include, you may need to set the
&#8216;ARCHFLAGS&#8217; environment variable explicitly:
</p>
<pre>
        sudo env ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64' gem install pg
</pre>
<p>
or, if you&#8217;re building from source:
</p>
<pre>
        rake compile ARCHFLAGS=&quot;-arch x86_64&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the recommended EnterpriseDB packages are correctly compiled as
universal binaries, and don&#8217;t need any of these workarounds.
