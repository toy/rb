        <h1>New Relic Ruby Agent</h1>
<p>
New Relic is a performance management system, developed by New Relic, Inc
(<a href="http://www.newrelic.com">www.newrelic.com</a>). It provides you
with deep information about the performance of your Rails or Ruby
application as it runs in production. The New Relic Ruby Agent is
dual-purposed as a either a Rails plugin or a Gem, hosted on <a
href="http://github.com/newrelic/rpm/tree/master">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
The New Relic Ruby Agent runs in one of two modes:
</p>
<h4>Production Mode</h4>
<p>
Low overhead instrumentation that captures detailed information on your
application running in production and transmits them to newrelic.com where
you can monitor them in real time.
</p>
<h4>Developer Mode</h4>
<p>
A Rack middleware that maps /newrelic to an application for showing
detailed performance metrics on a page by page basis. Installed
automatically in Rails applications.
</p>
<h2>Supported Environments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.1, or 1.9.2, including REE

</li>
<li>JRuby 1.4 or higher

</li>
<li>Rails 2.0 or later for Production Mode

</li>
<li>Rails 2.3 or later for Developer Mode

</li>
<li>Sinatra

</li>
<li>Rack

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any Rack based framework should work but may not be tested. Install the
Ruby Agent as a gem and add the Developer Mode middleware if desired.
Report any problems to support@newrelic.com.
</p>
<p>
You can also monitor non-web applications. Refer to the &#8220;Other
Environments&#8221; section under &#8220;Getting Started&#8221;.
</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
Install the Ruby Agent as a gem. If you are using Rails you can install the
gem as a plug-in&#8212;details below.
</p>
<pre>
   gem install newrelic_rpm
</pre>
<p>
To monitor your applications in production, create an account at <a
href="http://newrelic.com/">newrelic.com/</a> . There you can sign up for a
free Lite account or one of our paid subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
Once you receive the welcome e-mail with a license key and <tt><a
href="newrelic_yml.html">newrelic.yml</a></tt> file, copy the <tt><a
href="newrelic_yml.html">newrelic.yml</a></tt> file into your app config
directory.
</p>
<p>
All agent configuration is done in the <tt><a
href="newrelic_yml.html">newrelic.yml</a></tt> file. This file is by
default read from the <tt>config</tt> directory of the application root and
is subsequently searched for in the application root directory, and then in
a <tt>~/.newrelic</tt> directory
</p>
<h3>Rails Installation</h3>
<p>
You can install the agent as a Gem:
</p>
<p>
For Bundler:
</p>
<p>
Add the following line to your Gemfile:
</p>
<pre>
    gem 'newrelic_rpm'
</pre>
<p>
For Rails 2.x without Bundler:
</p>
<p>
edit <tt>environment.rb</tt> and add to the initalizer block:
</p>
<pre>
    config.gem &quot;newrelic_rpm&quot;
</pre>
<h3>Merb Installation</h3>
<p>
To monitor a merb app install the newrelic_rpm gem and add
</p>
<pre>
    dependency 'newrelic_rpm'
</pre>
<p>
to your init.rb file.
</p>
<h3>Sinatra Installation</h3>
<p>
To use the Ruby Agent with a Sinatra app, add
</p>
<pre>
    require 'newrelic_rpm'
</pre>
<p>
in your Sinatra app, below the Sinatra require directive.
</p>
<p>
Then make sure you set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the
configuration definitions in the <a
href="newrelic_yml.html">newrelic.yml</a> file; i.e., development, staging,
production, etc.
</p>
<p>
To use Developer Mode in Sinatra, add <a
href="../classes/NewRelic/Rack/DeveloperMode.html">NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode</a>
to the middleware stack. See the <tt>config.ru</tt> sample below.
</p>
<h3>Other Environments</h3>
<p>
You can use the Ruby Agent to monitor any Ruby application. Add
</p>
<pre>
    require 'newrelic_rpm'
</pre>
<p>
to your startup sequence and then manually start the agent using
</p>
<pre>
    NewRelic::Agent.manual_start
</pre>
<p>
To instrument Rack based applications, refer to the docs in <a
href="../classes/NewRelic/Agent/Instrumentation/Rack.html">NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack</a>.
</p>
<p>
Refer to the docs in New Relic for details on how to monitor other web
frameworks, background jobs, and daemons.
</p>
<p>
Also, see if your environment is already supported by the <a
href="http://newrelic.github.com/rpm_contrib">rpm_contrib</a> gem.
</p>
<h2>Developer Mode</h2>
<p>
When running the Developer Mode, the Ruby Agent will track the performance
of every HTTP request serviced by your application, and store in memory
this information for the last 100 HTTP transactions.
</p>
<p>
To view this performance information, including detailed SQL statement
analysis, open <tt>/newrelic</tt> in your web application. For instance if
you are running mongrel or thin on port 3000, enter the following into your
browser:
</p>
<pre>
    http://localhost:3000/newrelic
</pre>
<p>
Developer Mode is only initialized if the <tt>developer_mode</tt> setting
in the <a href="newrelic_yml.html">newrelic.yml</a> file is set to true. By
default, it is turned off in all environments but <tt>development</tt>.
</p>
<h4>Developer Mode in Rails</h4>
<p>
Developer Mode is available automatically in Rails Applications based on
Rails 2.3 and later. No additional configuration is required. When your
application starts and <tt>developer_mode</tt> is enabled, the Ruby Agent
injects a middleware into your Rails middleware stack.
</p>
<p>
For earlier versions of Rails that support Rack, you can use a
<tt>config.ru</tt> as below.
</p>
<h4>Developer Mode in Rack Applications</h4>
<p>
Developer Mode is available for any Rack based application such as Sinatra
by installing the <a
href="../classes/NewRelic/Rack/DeveloperMode.html">NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode</a>
middleware. This middleware passes all requests that do not start with
/newrelic.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s an example entry for Developer Mode in a <tt>config.ru</tt>
file:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode'
    use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode
</pre>
<h2>Production Mode</h2>
<p>
When your application runs in the production environment, the New Relic
agent runs in production mode. It connects to the New Relic service and
sends deep performance data to the UI for your analysis. To view this data,
log in to <a href="http://rpm.newrelic.com.">rpm.newrelic.com.</a>
</p>
<p>
NOTE: You must have a valid account and license key to view this data
online. Refer to instructions in *Getting Started*, below.
