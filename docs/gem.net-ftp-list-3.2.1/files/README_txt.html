        <h1>Net::Ftp::List</h1>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Ruby lib to parse FTP LIST responses.
</p>
<p>
According to the FTP RFC the LIST command &#8220;information on a file may
vary widely from system to system, this information may be hard to use
automatically in a program, but may be quite useful to a human user&#8221;.
Unfortunately the NLST command &#8220;intended to return information that
can be used by a program to further process the files automatically&#8221;
only returns the filename and no other information. If you want to know to
know even simple things like &#8216;is the NLST entry a directory or
file&#8217; you are left with the choice of attempting to CWD to (and back
from) each entry or parsing the LIST command. This extension is an attempt
at parsing the LIST command and as such is subject to all the variability
that results from such an undertaking, take responses with a grain of salt
and expect failures.
</p>
<p>
See the RFC for more guff on LIST and NLST: <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt">www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt</a>
</p>
<h2>TODO &amp; PROBLEMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>The factory and abstract base class for parsers are one and the same. OO
geeks will cry.

</li>
<li>More OS&#8217;s and server types. Only servers that return Unix like LIST
responses will work at the moment.

</li>
<li>Calling <tt>if entry.file? or entry.dir?</tt> is hard work when you really
mean <tt>unless entry.unknown?</tt>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
  require 'net/ftp' # Not really required but I like to list dependencies sometimes.
  require 'net/ftp/list'

  ftp = Net::FTP.open('somehost.com', 'user', 'pass')
  ftp.list('/some/path') do |e|
    entry = Net::FTP::List.parse(e)

    # Ignore everything that's not a file (so symlinks, directories and devices etc.)
    next unless entry.file?

    # If entry isn't entry.unknown? then there is a bug in Net::FTP::List if this isn't the
    # same name as ftp.nlist('/some/path') would have returned.
    # Format the entry showing its file size and modification time
    puts &quot;#{entry.basename}, #{entry.filesize}, #{entry.mtime}&quot;

  end
