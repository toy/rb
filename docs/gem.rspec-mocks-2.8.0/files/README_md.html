<p>
rspec-mocks is a test-double framework for rspec with support for method
stubs, fakes, and message expectations on generated test-doubles and real
objects alike.
</p>
<p>
## Install
</p>
<pre>
    gem install rspec       # for rspec-core, rspec-expectations, rspec-mocks
    gem install rspec-mocks # for rspec-mocks only
</pre>
<p>
## Test Doubles
</p>
<p>
A Test Double is an object that stands in for a real object in a test. <a
href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> creates test doubles that support
method stubs and message expectations.
</p>
<p>
```ruby book = double(&#8220;book&#8221;) ```
</p>
<p>
## Method Stubs
</p>
<p>
A method stub is an implementation that returns a pre-determined value.
Method stubs can be declared on test doubles or real objects using the same
syntax. rspec-mocks supports 3 forms for declaring method stubs:
</p>
<p>
```ruby book.stub(:title) { &#8220;The <a
href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> Book&#8221; } book.stub(:title =>
&#8220;The <a href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> Book&#8221;)
book.stub(:title).and_return(&#8220;The <a
href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> Book&#8221;) ```
</p>
<p>
You can also use this shortcut, which creates a test double and declares a
method stub in one statement:
</p>
<p>
```ruby book = double(&#8220;book&#8221;, :title => &#8220;The <a
href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> Book&#8221;) ```
</p>
<p>
The first argment is a name, which is used for documentation and appears in
failure messages. If you don&#8217;t care about the name, you can leave it
out, making the combined instantiation/stub declaration very terse:
</p>
<p>
```ruby double(:foo => &#8216;bar&#8217;) ```
</p>
<p>
This is particularly nice when providing a list of test doubles to a method
that iterates through them:
</p>
<p>
```ruby order.calculate_total_price(stub(:price => 1.99),stub(:price =>
2.99)) ```
</p>
<p>
## Consecutive return values
</p>
<p>
When a stub might be invoked more than once, you can provide additional
arguments to `and_return`. The invocations cycle through the list. The last
value is returned for any subsequent invocations:
</p>
<p>
```ruby die.stub(:roll).and_return(1,2,3) die.roll # => 1 die.roll # => 2
die.roll # => 3 die.roll # => 3 die.roll # => 3 ```
</p>
<p>
To return an array in a single invocation, declare an array:
</p>
<p>
```ruby team.stub(:players).and_return([stub(:name =>
&#8220;David&#8221;)]) ```
</p>
<p>
## Message Expectations
</p>
<p>
A message expectation is an expectation that the test double will receive a
message some time before the example ends. If the message is received, the
expectation is satisfied. If not, the example fails.
</p>
<p>
```ruby validator = double(&#8220;validator&#8221;)
validator.should_receive(:validate).with(&#8220;02134&#8221;) zipcode =
Zipcode.new(&#8220;02134&#8221;, validator) zipcode.valid? ```
</p>
<p>
## Nomenclature
</p>
<p>
### Mock Objects and Test Stubs
</p>
<p>
The names Mock Object and Test Stub suggest specialized Test Doubles. i.e.
a Test Stub is a Test Double that only supports method stubs, and a Mock
Object is a Test Double that supports message expectations and method
stubs.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of overlapping nomenclature here, and there are many
variations of these patterns (fakes, spies, etc). Keep in mind that most of
the time we&#8217;re talking about method-level concepts that are
variations of method stubs and message expectations, and we&#8217;re
applying to them to <em>one</em> generic kind of object: a Test Double.
</p>
<p>
### Test-Specific Extension
</p>
<p>
a.k.a. Partial Stub/Mock, a Test-Specific Extension is an extension of a
real object in a system that is instrumented with test-double like
behaviour in the context of a test. This technique is very common in Ruby
because we often see class objects acting as global namespaces for methods.
For example, in Rails:
</p>
<p>
```ruby person = double(&#8220;person&#8221;) Person.stub(:find) { person }
```
</p>
<p>
In this case we&#8217;re instrumenting Person to return the person object
we&#8217;ve defined whenever it receives the `find` message. We can do this
with any object in a system because rspec-mocks adds the `stub` and
`should_receive` methods to every object. When we use either, <a
href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> replaces the method we&#8217;re
stubbing or mocking with its own test-double-like method. At the end of the
example, <a href="../classes/RSpec.html">RSpec</a> verifies any message
expectations, and then restores the original methods.
</p>
<p>
## Expecting Arguments
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg).with(*args)
double.should_not_receive(:msg).with(*args) ```
</p>
<p>
## Argument Matchers
</p>
<p>
Arguments that are passed to `with` are compared with actual arguments
received using ==. In cases in which you want to specify things about the
arguments rather than the arguments themselves, you can use any of the
matchers that ship with rspec-expectations. They don&#8217;t all make
syntactic sense (they were primarily designed for use with
RSpec::Expectations), but you are free to create your own custom
RSpec::Matchers.
</p>
<p>
rspec-mocks also adds some keyword Symbols that you can use to specify
certain kinds of arguments:
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg).with(no_args())
double.should_receive(:msg).with(any_args())
double.should_receive(:msg).with(1, kind_of(Numeric), &#8220;b&#8221;) 2nd
argument can any kind of Numeric double.should_receive(:msg).with(1,
boolean(), &#8220;b&#8221;) 2nd argument can true or false
double.should_receive(:msg).with(1, /abc/, &#8220;b&#8221;) 2nd argument
can be any String matching the submitted Regexp
double.should_receive(:msg).with(1, anything(), &#8220;b&#8221;) 2nd
argument can be anything at all double.should_receive(:msg).with(1,
ducktype(:abs, :div), &#8220;b&#8221;)
</p>
<pre>
                    #2nd argument can be object that responds to #abs and #div
</pre>
<p>
```
</p>
<p>
## Receive Counts
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg).once double.should_receive(:msg).twice
double.should_receive(:msg).exactly(n).times
double.should_receive(:msg).at_least(:once)
double.should_receive(:msg).at_least(:twice)
double.should_receive(:msg).at_least(n).times
double.should_receive(:msg).at_most(:once)
double.should_receive(:msg).at_most(:twice)
double.should_receive(:msg).at_most(n).times
double.should_receive(:msg).any_number_of_times ```
</p>
<p>
## Ordering
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg).ordered
double.should_receive(:other_msg).ordered
</p>
<pre>
  #This will fail if the messages are received out of order
</pre>
<p>
```
</p>
<p>
## Setting Reponses
</p>
<p>
Whether you are setting a message expectation or a method stub, you can
tell the object precisely how to respond. The most generic way is to pass a
block to `stub` or `should_receive`:
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg) { value } ```
</p>
<p>
When the double receives the `msg` message, it evaluates the block and
returns the result.
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg).and_return(value)
double.should_receive(:msg).exactly(3).times.and_return(value1, value2,
value3)
</p>
<pre>
  # returns value1 the first time, value2 the second, etc
</pre>
<p>
double.should_receive(:msg).and_raise(error)
</p>
<pre>
  #error can be an instantiated object or a class
  #if it is a class, it must be instantiable with no args
</pre>
<p>
double.should_receive(:msg).and_throw(:msg)
double.should_receive(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield)
double.should_receive(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield).and_yield(some,other,values,this,time)
</p>
<pre>
  # for methods that yield to a block multiple times
</pre>
<p>
```
</p>
<p>
Any of these responses can be applied to a stub as well
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.stub(:msg).and_return(value)
double.stub(:msg).and_return(value1, value2, value3)
double.stub(:msg).and_raise(error) double.stub(:msg).and_throw(:msg)
double.stub(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield)
double.stub(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield).and_yield(some,other,values,this,time)
```
</p>
<p>
## Arbitrary Handling
</p>
<p>
Once in a while you&#8217;ll find that the available expectations
don&#8217;t solve the particular problem you are trying to solve. Imagine
that you expect the message to come with an Array argument that has a
specific length, but you don&#8217;t care what is in it. You could do this:
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:msg) do |arg|
</p>
<pre>
  arg.size.should eq(7)
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
## Combining Expectation Details
</p>
<p>
Combining the message name with specific arguments, receive counts and
responses you can get quite a bit of detail in your expectations:
</p>
<p>
```ruby double.should_receive(:<<).with(&#8220;illegal
value&#8221;).once.and_raise(ArgumentError) ```
</p>
<p>
While this is a good thing when you really need it, you probably
don&#8217;t really need it! Take care to specify only the things that
matter to the behavior of your code.
