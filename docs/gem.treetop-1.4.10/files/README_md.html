Tutorial
</p>
<h6>==</h6>
<p>
Languages can be split into two components, their <b>syntax</b> and their
<b>semantics</b>. It&#8217;s your understanding of English syntax that
tells you the stream of words &#8220;Sleep furiously green ideas
colorless&#8221; is not a valid sentence. Semantics is deeper. Even if we
rearrange the above sentence to be &#8220;Colorless green ideas sleep
furiously&#8221;, which is syntactically correct, it remains nonsensical on
a semantic level. With Treetop, you&#8217;ll be dealing with languages that
are much simpler than English, but these basic concepts apply. Your
programs will need to address both the syntax and the semantics of the
languages they interpret.
</p>
<p>
Treetop equips you with powerful tools for each of these two aspects of
interpreter writing. You&#8217;ll describe the syntax of your language with
a *parsing expression grammar*. From this description, Treetop will
generate a Ruby parser that transforms streams of characters written into
your language into *abstract syntax trees* representing their structure.
You&#8217;ll then describe the semantics of your language in Ruby by
defining methods on the syntax trees the parser generates.
</p>
<p>
Parsing Expression Grammars, The Basics
</p>
<h6>=================================</h6>
<p>
The first step in using Treetop is defining a grammar in a file with the
`.treetop` extension. Here&#8217;s a grammar that&#8217;s useless because
it&#8217;s empty:
</p>
<pre>
    # my_grammar.treetop
    grammar MyGrammar
    end
</pre>
<p>
Next, you start filling your grammar with rules. Each rule associates a
name with a parsing expression, like the following:
</p>
<pre>
    # my_grammar.treetop
    # You can use a .tt extension instead if you wish
    grammar MyGrammar
      rule hello
        'hello chomsky'
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
The first rule becomes the <b>root</b> of the grammar, causing its
expression to be matched when a parser for the grammar is fed a string. The
above grammar can now be used in a Ruby program. Notice how a string
matching the first rule parses successfully, but a second nonmatching
string does not.
</p>
<pre>
    # use_grammar.rb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'treetop'
    Treetop.load 'my_grammar'
    # or just:
    # require 'my_grammar'                     # This works because Polyglot hooks &quot;require&quot; to find and load Treetop files

    parser = MyGrammarParser.new
    puts parser.parse('hello chomsky')         # =&gt; Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode
    puts parser.parse('silly generativists!')  # =&gt; nil
</pre>
<p>
Users of *regular expressions* will find parsing expressions familiar. They
share the same basic purpose, matching strings against patterns. However,
parsing expressions can recognize a broader category of languages than
their less expressive brethren. Before we get into demonstrating that, lets
cover some basics. At first parsing expressions won&#8217;t seem much
different. Trust that they are.
</p>
<p>
Terminal Symbols
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
The expression in the grammar above is a terminal symbol. It will only
match a string that matches it exactly. There are two other kinds of
terminal symbols, which we&#8217;ll revisit later. Terminals are called
*atomic expressions* because they aren&#8217;t composed of smaller
expressions.
</p>
<p>
Ordered Choices
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
Ordered choices are *composite expressions*, which allow for any of several
subexpressions to be matched. These should be familiar from regular
expressions, but in parsing expressions, they are delimited by the `/`
character. Its important to note that the choices are prioritized in the
order they appear. If an earlier expression is matched, no subsequent
expressions are tried. Here&#8217;s an example:
</p>
<pre>
    # my_grammar.treetop
    grammar MyGrammar
      rule hello
        'hello chomsky' / 'hello lambek'
      end
    end

    # fragment of use_grammar.rb
    puts parser.parse('hello chomsky')         # =&gt; Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode
    puts parser.parse('hello lambek')          # =&gt; Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode
    puts parser.parse('silly generativists!')  # =&gt; nil
</pre>
<p>
Note that once a choice rule has matched the text using a particular
alternative at a particular location in the input and hence has succeeded,
that choice will never be reconsidered, even if the chosen alternative
causes another rule to fail where a later alternative wouldn&#8217;t have.
It&#8217;s always a later alternative, since the first to succeed is final
- why keep looking when you&#8217;ve found what you wanted? This is a
feature of PEG parsers that you need to understand if you&#8217;re going to
succeed in using Treetop. In order to memoize success and failures, such
decisions cannot be reversed. Luckily Treetop provides a variety of clever
ways you can tell it to avoid making the wrong decisions. But more on that
later.
</p>
<p>
Sequences
</p>
<hr size="7"></hr><p>
Sequences are composed of other parsing expressions separated by spaces.
Using sequences, we can tighten up the above grammar.
</p>
<pre>
    # my_grammar.treetop
    grammar MyGrammar
      rule hello
        'hello ' ('chomsky' / 'lambek')
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of parentheses to override the default precedence rules, which
bind sequences more tightly than choices.
</p>
<p>
Once the whole sequence has been matched, the result is memoized and the
details of the match will not be reconsidered for that location in the
input.
</p>
<p>
Nonterminal Symbols
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
Here we leave regular expressions behind. Nonterminals allow expressions to
refer to other expressions by name. A trivial use of this facility would
allow us to make the above grammar more readable should the list of names
grow longer.
</p>
<pre>
    # my_grammar.treetop
    grammar MyGrammar
      rule hello
        'hello ' linguist
      end

      rule linguist
        'chomsky' / 'lambek' / 'jacobsen' / 'frege'
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
The true power of this facility, however, is unleashed when writing
*recursive expressions*. Here is a self-referential expression that can
match any number of open parentheses followed by any number of closed
parentheses. This is theoretically impossible with regular expressions due
to the *pumping lemma*.
</p>
<pre>
    # parentheses.treetop
    grammar Parentheses
      rule parens
        '(' parens ')' / ''
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
The `parens` expression simply states that a `parens` is a set of
parentheses surrounding another `parens` expression or, if that
doesn&#8217;t match, the empty string. If you are uncomfortable with
recursion, its time to get comfortable, because it is the basis of
language. Here&#8217;s a tip: Don&#8217;t try and imagine the parser
circling round and round through the same rule. Instead, imagine the rule
is <b>already</b> defined while you are defining it. If you imagine that
`parens` already matches a string of matching parentheses, then its easy to
think of `parens` as an open and closing parentheses around another set of
matching parentheses, which conveniently, you happen to be defining. You
know that `parens` is supposed to represent a string of matched
parentheses, so trust in that meaning, even if you haven&#8217;t fully
implemented it yet.
</p>
<p>
Repetition
</p>
<hr size="8"></hr><p>
Any item in a rule may be followed by a &#8217;+&#8217; or a
&#8217;*&#8217; character, signifying one-or-more and zero-or-more
occurrences of that item. Beware though; the match is greedy, and if it
matches too many items and causes subsequent items in the sequence to fail,
the number matched will never be reconsidered. Here&#8217;s a simple
example of a rule that will never succeed:
</p>
<pre>
    # toogreedy.treetop
    grammar TooGreedy
      rule a_s
        'a'* 'a'
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
The &#8216;a&#8217;* will always eat up any &#8216;a&#8217;s that follow,
and the subsequent &#8216;a&#8217; will find none there, so the whole rule
will fail. You might need to use lookahead to avoid matching too much.
Alternatively, you can use an occurrence range:
</p>
<pre>
    # toogreedy.treetop
    grammar TooGreedy
      rule two_to_four_as
        'a' 2..4
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
In an occurrence range, you may omit either the minimum count or the
maximum count, so that &#8220;0.. &#8220; works like &#8220;*&#8221; and
&#8220;1.. &#8220; works like &#8217;+&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
Negative Lookahead
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
When you need to ensure that the following item *doesn&#8217;t* match in
some case where it might otherwise, you can use negat!ve lookahead, which
is an item preceeded by a ! - here&#8217;s an example:
</p>
<pre>
    # postcondition.treetop
    grammar PostCondition
      rule conditional_sentence
        ( !conditional_keyword word )+ conditional_keyword [ \t]+ word*
      end

      rule word
        ([a-zA-Z]+ [ \t]+)
      end

      rule conditional_keyword
        'if' / 'while' / 'until'
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Even though the rule `word` would match any of the conditional keywords,
the first words of a conditional_sentence must not be conditional_keywords.
The negative lookahead prevents that matching, and prevents the repetition
from matching too much input. Note that the lookahead may be a grammar rule
of any complexity, including one that isn&#8217;t used elsewhere in your
grammar.
</p>
<p>
Positive lookahead
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
Sometimes you want an item to match, but only if the <b>following</b> text
would match some pattern. You don&#8217;t want to consume that following
text, but if it&#8217;s not there, you want this rule to fail. You can
append a positive lookahead like this to a rule by appending the lookahead
rule preceeded by an &amp; character.
</p>
<p>
Semantic predicates
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
Warning: This is an advanced feature. You need to understand the way a
packrat parser operates to use it correctly. The result of computing a rule
containing a semantic predicate will be memoized, even if the same rule,
applied later at the same location in the input, would work differently due
to a semantic predicate returning a different value. If you don&#8217;t
understand the previous sentence yet still use this feature, you&#8217;re
on your own, so test carefully!
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, you need to run external Ruby code to decide whether this syntax
rule should continue or should fail. You can do this using either positive
or negative semantic predicates. These are Ruby code blocks (lambdas) which
are called when the parser reaches that location. For this rule to succeed,
the value must be true for a positive predicate (a block like &amp;{
&#8230; }), or false for a negative predicate (a block like !{ &#8230; }).
</p>
<p>
The block is called with one argument, the array containing the preceding
syntax nodes in the current sequence. Within the block, you cannot use node
names or labels for the preceding nodes, as the node for the current rule
does not yet exist. You must refer to preceding nodes using their position
in the sequence.
</p>
<pre>
    grammar Keywords
      rule sequence_of_reserved_and_nonreserved_words
        ( reserved / word )*
      end

      rule reserved
        word &amp;{ |s| symbol_reserved?(s[0].text_value) }
      end

      rule word
        ([a-zA-Z]+ [ \t]+)
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
One case where it is always safe to use a semantic predicate is to invoke
the Ruby debugger, but don&#8217;t forget to return true so the rule
succeeds! Assuming you have required the &#8216;ruby-debug&#8217; module
somewhere, it looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
      rule problems
        word &amp;{ |s| debugger; true }
      end
</pre>
<p>
When the debugger stops here, you can inspect the contents of the
SyntaxNode for &#8220;word&#8221; by looking at s[0], and the stack trace
will show how you got there.
