<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> aims to simplify the
process of integration testing Rack applications, such as Rails, Sinatra or
Merb. <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> simulates how a real
user would interact with a web application. It is agnostic about the driver
running your tests and currently comes with Rack::Test and Selenium support
built in. HtmlUnit, WebKit and env.js are supported through external gems.
</p>

sure your patches are well tested, <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> is a testing tool after all.
Please create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> uses bundler in
development. To set up a development environment, simply do:
</p>
<pre>
    git submodule update --init
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
</pre>
<h2>Using <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with Cucumber</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> is built to work nicely
with Cucumber. Support for <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a>
is built into cucumber-rails. In your Rails app, just run:
</p>
<pre>
    rails generate cucumber:install --capybara
</pre>
<p>
And everything should be set up and ready to go.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with
Cucumber outside Rails (for example with Merb or Sinatra), you&#8217;ll
need to require <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> and set the
Rack app manually:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'capybara/cucumber'
    Capybara.app = MyRackApp
</pre>
<p>
Now you can use it in your steps:
</p>
<pre>
    When /I sign in/ do
      within(&quot;#session&quot;) do
        fill_in 'Login', :with =&gt; 'user@example.com'
        fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; 'password'
      end
      click_link 'Sign in'
    end
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> sets up some <a
href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tags">tags</a> for you
to use in Cucumber. Often you&#8217;ll want to run only some scenarios with
a driver that supports JavaScript, <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> makes this easy: simply tag
the scenario (or feature) with <tt>@javascript</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    @javascript
    Scenario: do something Ajaxy
      When I click the Ajax link
      ...
</pre>
<p>
You can change which driver <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a>
uses for JavaScript:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.javascript_driver = :culerity
</pre>
<p>
There are also explicit <tt>@selenium</tt>, <tt>@culerity</tt> and
<tt>@rack_test</tt> tags set up for you.
</p>
<h2>Using <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with RSpec</h2>
<p>
If you prefer RSpec to using Cucumber, you can use the built in RSpec
support by adding the following line (typically to your
<tt>spec_helper.rb</tt> file):
</p>
<pre>
    require 'capybara/rspec'
</pre>
<p>
You can now write your specs like so:
</p>
<pre>
    describe &quot;the signup process&quot;, :type =&gt; :request do
      before :each do
        User.make(:email =&gt; 'user@example.com', :password =&gt; 'caplin')
      end

      it &quot;signs me in&quot; do
        within(&quot;#session&quot;) do
          fill_in 'Login', :with =&gt; 'user@example.com'
          fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; 'password'
        end
        click_link 'Sign in'
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> is only included in example
groups tagged with <tt>:type =&gt; :request</tt> (or <tt>:acceptance</tt>
for compatibility with Steak).
</p>
<p>
If you are testing a Rails app and using the <tt>rspec-rails</tt> gem,
these <tt>:request</tt> example groups may look familiar to you.
That&#8217;s because they are RSpec versions of Rails integration tests.
So, in this case essentially what you are getting are Capybara-enhanced
request specs. This means that you can use the <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> helpers <em>and</em> you have
access to things like named route helpers in your tests (so you are able to
say, for instance, <tt>visit edit_user_path(user)</tt>, instead of
<tt>visit &quot;/users/#{user.id}/edit&quot;</tt>, if you prefer that sort
of thing). A good place to put these specs is <tt>spec/requests</tt>, as
<tt>rspec-rails</tt> will automatically tag them with <tt>:type =&gt;
:request</tt>. (In fact, <tt>spec/integration</tt> and
<tt>spec/acceptance</tt> will work just as well.)
</p>
<p>
<tt>rspec-rails</tt> will also automatically include <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> in <tt>:controller</tt> and
<tt>:mailer</tt> example groups.
</p>
<p>
RSpec&#8217;s metadata feature can be used to switch to a different driver.
Use <tt>:js =&gt; true</tt> to switch to the javascript driver, or provide
a <tt>:driver</tt> option to switch to one specific driver. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    describe 'some stuff which requires js', :js =&gt; true do
      it 'will use the default js driver'
      it 'will switch to one specific driver', :driver =&gt; :celerity
    end
</pre>
<p>
Finally, <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> also comes with a
built in DSL for creating descriptive acceptance tests:
</p>
<pre>
    feature &quot;Signing up&quot; do
      background do
        User.make(:email =&gt; 'user@example.com', :password =&gt; 'caplin')
      end

      scenario &quot;Signing in with correct credentials&quot; do
        within(&quot;#session&quot;) do
          fill_in 'Login', :with =&gt; 'user@example.com'
          fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; 'caplin'
        end
        click_link 'Sign in'
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
This is, in fact, just a shortcut for making a request spec, where
<tt>feature</tt> is an alias for <tt>describe ..., :type =&gt;
:request</tt>, <tt>background</tt> is an alias for <tt>before</tt>, and
<tt>scenario</tt> is an alias for <tt>it</tt>/<tt>specify</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Note that Capybara&#8217;s built in RSpec support only works with RSpec 2.0
or later. You&#8217;ll need to roll your own for earlier versions of RSpec.
</p>
<h2>Using <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with Test::Unit</h2>
<p>
To use <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with Test::Unit,
include the DSL (<tt>include Capybara</tt> up until version 0.4.x,
<tt>include Capybara::DSL</tt> for newer versions) in whatever test class
you are using. For example, if your classes derive from
<tt>ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest</tt>, use
</p>
<pre>
    class ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
      include Capybara::DSL
    end
</pre>
<p>
Test::Unit does not support selecting the driver through test metadata, but
you can switch the driver for specific classes using the <tt>setup</tt> and
<tt>teardown</tt> methods. See the section &#8220;Selecting the
Driver&#8221;.
</p>
<h2>Using <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p>
If you are using the Rails framework, add this line to automatically
configure <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> to test against
your Rails application:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'capybara/rails'
</pre>
<h2>Using <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with Rack</h2>
<p>
If you&#8217;re using <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> with
a non-Rails Rack application, set <tt><a
href="../classes/Capybara.html#app">Capybara.app</a></tt> to your
application class:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.app = MyRackApp
</pre>
<h2>Drivers</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> uses the same DSL to drive
a variety of browser and headless drivers.
</p>
<h3>Selecting the Driver</h3>
<p>
By default, <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> uses the
<tt>:rack_test</tt> driver, which is fast but does not support JavaScript.
You can set up a different default driver for your features. For example if
you&#8217;d prefer to run everything in Selenium, you could do:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
</pre>
<p>
However, if you are using RSpec or Cucumber, you may instead want to
consider leaving the faster <tt>:rack_test</tt> as the
<tt>default_driver</tt>, and marking only those tests that require a
JavaScript-capable driver using <tt>:js =&gt; true</tt> or
<tt>@javascript</tt>, respectively. By default, JavaScript tests are run
using the <tt>:selenium</tt> driver. You can change this by setting <tt><a
href="../classes/Capybara.html#M000039">Capybara.javascript_driver</a></tt>.
</p>
<p>
You can also change the driver temporarily (typically in the Before/setup
and After/teardown blocks):
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.current_driver = :culerity  # temporarily select different driver
    ... tests ...
    Capybara.use_default_driver  # switch back to default driver
</pre>
<p>
Note that switching the driver creates a new session, so you may not be
able to switch in the middle of a test.
</p>
<h3>RackTest</h3>
<p>
RackTest is Capybara&#8217;s default driver. It is written in pure Ruby and
does not have any support for executing JavaScript. Since the RackTest
driver works directly agains the Rack interface, it does not need any
server to be started, it can work directly work against any Rack app. This
means that if your application is not a Rack application (Rails, Sinatra
and most other Ruby frameworks are Rack applications) then you cannot use
this driver. You cannot use the RackTest driver to test a remote
application. <a
href="https://github.com/jeroenvandijk/capybara-mechanize">capybara-mechanize</a>
intends to provide a similar driver which works against remote servers, it
is a separate project.
</p>
<p>
RackTest can be configured with a set of headers like this:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.register_driver :rack_test do |app|
      Capybara::RackTest::Driver.new(app, :browser =&gt; :chrome)
    end
</pre>
<p>
See the section on adding and configuring drivers.
</p>
<h3>Selenium</h3>
<p>
At the moment, <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> supports <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/01_introducing_selenium.html#selenium-2-aka-selenium-webdriver">Selenium
2.0 (Webdriver)</a>, <b>not</b> Selenium RC. Provided Firefox is installed,
everything is set up for you, and you should be able to start using
Selenium right away.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> can block and wait for Ajax
requests to finish after you&#8217;ve interacted with the page. To enable
this behaviour, set the <tt>:resynchronize</tt> driver option to
<tt>true</tt>. This should normally not be necessary, since
Capybara&#8217;s automatic reloading should take care of any asynchronicity
problems. See the section on Asynchronous JavaScript for details.
</p>
<p>
Note: Selenium does not support transactional fixtures; see the section
&#8220;Transactional Fixtures&#8221; below.
</p>
<h3>HtmlUnit</h3>
<p>
There are three different drivers, maintained as external gems, that you
can use to drive <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/">HtmlUnit</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bernerdschaefer/akephalos">Akephalos</a> might
be the best HtmlUnit driver right now.

</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sobrinho/capybara-celerity">Celerity</a> only
runs on JRuby, so you&#8217;ll need to install the celerity gem under
JRuby: <tt>jruby -S gem install celerity</tt>

</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sobrinho/capybara-culerity">Culerity</a>:
Install celerity as noted above, and make sure that JRuby is in your path.
Note that Culerity does not seem to be working under Ruby 1.9 at the
moment.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: HtmlUnit does not support transactional fixtures; see the section
&#8220;Transactional Fixtures&#8221; below.
</p>
<h3>env.js</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://github.com/smparkes/capybara-envjs">capybara-envjs
driver</a> uses the envjs gem (<a
href="http://github.com/smparkes/env-js">GitHub</a>, <a
href="http://rubygems.org/gems/envjs">rubygems.org</a>) to interpret
JavaScript outside the browser. The driver is installed by installing the
capybara-envjs gem:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install capybara-envjs
</pre>
<p>
More info about the driver and env.js are available through the links
above. The envjs gem only supports Ruby 1.8.7 at this time.
</p>
<p>
Note: Envjs does not support transactional fixtures; see the section
&#8220;Transactional Fixtures&#8221; below.
</p>
<h3>Capybara-webkit</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">capybara-webkit
drive</a> is for true headless testing. It uses WebKitQt to start a
rendering engine process. It can execute JavaScript as well. It is
significantly faster than drivers like Selenium since it does not load an
entire browser.
</p>
<p>
You can install it with:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install capybara-webkit
</pre>
<p>
And you can use it by:
</p>
<pre>
  Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
</pre>
<h2>The DSL</h2>
<p>
Capybara&#8217;s DSL (domain-specific language) is inspired by Webrat.
While backwards compatibility is retained in a lot of cases, there are
certain important differences. Unlike in Webrat, all searches in <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> are *case sensitive*. This is
because <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> heavily uses XPath,
which doesn&#8217;t support case insensitivity.
</p>
<h3>Navigating</h3>
<p>
You can use the <tt><a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Session#visit-instance_method">visit</a></tt>
method to navigate to other pages:
</p>
<pre>
    visit('/projects')
    visit(post_comments_path(post))
</pre>
<p>
The visit method only takes a single parameter, the request method is
<b>always</b> GET.
</p>
<p>
You can get the <a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Session#current_path-instance_method">current
path</a> of the browsing session for test assertions:
</p>
<pre>
    current_path.should == post_comments_path(post)
</pre>
<h3>Clicking links and buttons</h3>
<p>
<em>Full reference: <a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions">Capybara::Node::Actions</a></em>
</p>
<p>
You can interact with the webapp by following links and buttons. <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> automatically follows any
redirects, and submits forms associated with buttons.
</p>
<pre>
    click_link('id-of-link')
    click_link('Link Text')
    click_button('Save')
    click_on('Link Text')  # clicks on either links or buttons
    click_on('Button Value')
</pre>
<h3>Interacting with forms</h3>
<p>
<em>Full reference: <a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions">Capybara::Node::Actions</a></em>
</p>
<p>
There are a number of tools for interacting with form elements:
</p>
<pre>
    fill_in('First Name', :with =&gt; 'John')
    fill_in('Password', :with =&gt; 'Seekrit')
    fill_in('Description', :with =&gt; 'Really Long Text...')
    choose('A Radio Button')
    check('A Checkbox')
    uncheck('A Checkbox')
    attach_file('Image', '/path/to/image.jpg')
    select('Option', :from =&gt; 'Select Box')
</pre>
<h3>Querying</h3>
<p>
<em>Full reference: <a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Matchers">Capybara::Node::Matchers</a></em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> has a rich set of options
for querying the page for the existence of certain elements, and working
with and manipulating those elements.
</p>
<pre>
    page.has_selector?('table tr')
    page.has_selector?(:xpath, '//table/tr')
    page.has_no_selector?(:content)

    page.has_xpath?('//table/tr')
    page.has_css?('table tr.foo')
    page.has_content?('foo')
</pre>
<p>
You can use these with RSpec&#8217;s magic matchers:
</p>
<pre>
    page.should have_selector('table tr')
    page.should have_selector(:xpath, '//table/tr')
    page.should have_no_selector(:content)

    page.should have_xpath('//table/tr')
    page.should have_css('table tr.foo')
    page.should have_content('foo')
    page.should have_no_content('foo')
</pre>
<p>
Note that <tt>page.should have_no_xpath</tt> is preferred over
<tt>page.should_not have_xpath</tt>. Read the section on asynchronous
JavaScript for an explanation.
</p>
<p>
If all else fails, you can also use the <tt><a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Session#html-instance_method">page.html</a></tt>
method to test against the raw HTML:
</p>
<pre>
    page.html.should match /&lt;span&gt;.../i
</pre>
<h3>Finding</h3>
<p>
<em>Full reference: <a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Finders">Capybara::Node::Finders</a></em>
</p>
<p>
You can also find specific elements, in order to manipulate them:
</p>
<pre>
    find_field('First Name').value
    find_link('Hello').visible?
    find_button('Send').click

    find(:xpath, &quot;//table/tr&quot;).click
    find(&quot;#overlay&quot;).find(&quot;h1&quot;).click
    all('a').each { |a| a[:href] }
</pre>
<p>
Note that <tt>find</tt> will wait for an element to appear on the page, as
explained in the Ajax section. If the element does not appear it will raise
an error.
</p>
<p>
These elements all have all the <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> DSL methods available, so you
can restrict them to specific parts of the page:
</p>
<pre>
    find('#navigation').click_link('Home')
    find('#navigation').should have_button('Sign out')
</pre>
<h3>Scoping</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> makes it possible to
restrict certain actions, such as interacting with forms or clicking links
and buttons, to within a specific area of the page. For this purpose you
can use the generic <tt><a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Session#within-instance_method">within</a></tt>
method. Optionally you can specify which kind of selector to use.
</p>
<pre>
    within(&quot;li#employee&quot;) do
      fill_in 'Name', :with =&gt; 'Jimmy'
    end

    within(:xpath, &quot;//li[@id='employee']&quot;) do
      fill_in 'Name', :with =&gt; 'Jimmy'
    end
</pre>
<p>
Note that <tt>within</tt> will scope the actions to the <em>first</em> (not
<em>any</em>) element that matches the selector.
</p>
<p>
There are special methods for restricting the scope to a specific fieldset,
identified by either an id or the text of the fieldet&#8217;s legend tag,
and to a specific table, identified by either id or text of the
table&#8217;s caption tag.
</p>
<pre>
    within_fieldset('Employee') do
      fill_in 'Name', :with =&gt; 'Jimmy'
    end

    within_table('Employee') do
      fill_in 'Name', :with =&gt; 'Jimmy'
    end
</pre>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>
In drivers which support it, you can easily execute JavaScript:
</p>
<pre>
    page.execute_script(&quot;$('body').empty()&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
For simple expressions, you can return the result of the script. Note that
this may break with more complicated expressions:
</p>
<pre>
    result = page.evaluate_script('4 + 4');
</pre>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>
It can be useful to take a snapshot of the page as it currently is and take
a look at it:
</p>
<pre>
    save_and_open_page
</pre>
<h2>Transactional fixtures</h2>
<p>
Transactional fixtures only work in the default Rack::Test driver, but not
for other drivers like Selenium. Cucumber takes care of this automatically,
but with Test::Unit or RSpec, you may have to use the <a
href="https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner">database_cleaner</a> gem.
See <a
href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ruby-capybara/JI6JrirL9gM/R6YiXj4gi_UJ">this
explanation</a> (and code for <a
href="http://opinionated-programmer.com/2011/02/capybara-and-selenium-with-rspec-and-rails-3/#comment-220">solution
2</a> and <a href="http://pastie.org/1745020">solution 3</a>) for details.
</p>
<h2>Asynchronous JavaScript (Ajax and friends)</h2>
<p>
When working with asynchronous JavaScript, you might come across situations
where you are attempting to interact with an element which is not yet
present on the page. <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a>
automatically deals with this by waiting for elements to appear on the
page.
</p>
<p>
When issuing instructions to the DSL such as:
</p>
<pre>
    click_link('foo')
    click_link('bar')
    page.should have_content('baz')
</pre>
<p>
If clicking on the <b>foo</b> link triggers an asynchronous process, such
as an Ajax request, which, when complete will add the <b>bar</b> link to
the page, clicking on the <b>bar</b> link would be expected to fail, since
that link doesn&#8217;t exist yet. However <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> is smart enought to retry
finding the link for a brief period of time before giving up and throwing
an error. The same is true of the next line, which looks for the content
<b>baz</b> on the page; it will retry looking for that content for a brief
time. You can adjust how long this period is (the default is 2 seconds):
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.default_wait_time = 5
</pre>
<p>
Be aware that because of this behaviour, the following two statements are
<b>not</b> equivalent, and you should <b>always</b> use the latter!
</p>
<pre>
    page.should_not have_xpath('a')
    page.should have_no_xpath('a')
</pre>
<p>
The former would incorrectly wait for the content to appear, since the
asynchronous process has not yet removed the element from the page, it
would therefore fail, even though the code might be working correctly. The
latter correctly waits for the element to disappear from the page.
</p>
<p>
Capybara&#8217;s waiting behaviour is quite advanced, and can deal with
situations such as the following line of code:
</p>
<pre>
    find('#sidebar').find('h1').should have_content('Something')
</pre>
<p>
Even if JavaScript causes <tt>sidebar</tt> to disappear off the page, <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> will automatically reload it
and any elements it contains. So if an AJAX request causes the contents of
<tt>sidebar</tt> to change, which would update the text of the <tt>h1</tt>
to &#8220;Something&#8221;, and this happened, this test would pass. If you
do not want this behaviour, you can set <tt><a
href="../classes/Capybara.html#automatic_reload">Capybara.automatic_reload</a></tt>
to <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
<h2>Using the DSL in unsupported testing frameworks</h2>
<p>
You can mix the DSL into any context by including +Capybara::DSL+:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'capybara'
    require 'capybara/dsl'

    Capybara.default_driver = :culerity

    module MyModule
      include Capybara::DSL

      def login!
        within(&quot;//form[@id='session']&quot;) do
          fill_in 'Login', :with =&gt; 'user@example.com'
          fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; 'password'
        end
        click_link 'Sign in'
      end
    end
</pre>
<h2>Calling remote servers</h2>
<p>
Normally <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> expects to be
testing an in-process Rack application, but you can also use it to talk to
a web server running anywhere on the internets, by setting app_host:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.current_driver = :selenium
    Capybara.app_host = 'http://www.google.com'
    ...
    visit('/')
</pre>
<p>
Note that the default driver (<tt>:rack_test</tt>) does not support running
against a remote server. With drivers that support it, you can also visit
any URL directly:
</p>
<pre>
    visit('http://www.google.com')
</pre>
<p>
By default <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> will try to boot
a rack application automatically. You might want to switch off
Capybara&#8217;s rack server if you are running against a remote
application:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.run_server = false
</pre>
<h2>Using the sessions manually</h2>
<p>
For ultimate control, you can instantiate and use a <a
href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Session">Session</a>
manually.
</p>
<pre>
    require 'capybara'

    session = Capybara::Session.new(:culerity, my_rack_app)
    session.within(&quot;//form[@id='session']&quot;) do
      session.fill_in 'Login', :with =&gt; 'user@example.com'
      session.fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; 'password'
    end
    session.click_link 'Sign in'
</pre>
<h2>XPath, CSS and selectors</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> does not try to guess what
kind of selector you are going to give it, and will always use CSS by
default. If you want to use XPath, you&#8217;ll need to do:
</p>
<pre>
    within(:xpath, '//ul/li') { ... }
    find(:xpath, '//ul/li').text
    find(:xpath, '//li[contains(.//a[@href = &quot;#&quot;]/text(), &quot;foo&quot;)]').value
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively you can set the default selector to XPath:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.default_selector = :xpath
    find('//ul/li').text
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> allows you to add custom
selectors, which can be very useful if you find yourself using the same
kinds of selectors very often:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.add_selector(:id) do
      xpath { |id| XPath.descendant[XPath.attr(:id) == id.to_s] }
    end

    Capybara.add_selector(:row) do
      xpath { |num| &quot;.//tbody/tr[#{num}]&quot; }
    end
</pre>
<p>
The block given to xpath must always return an XPath expression as a
String, or an XPath expression generated through the XPath gem. You can now
use these selectors like this:
</p>
<pre>
    find(:id, 'post_123')
    find(:row, 3)
</pre>
<p>
You can specify an optional match option which will automatically use the
selector if it matches the argument:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.add_selector(:id) do
      xpath { |id| XPath.descendant[XPath.attr(:id) == id.to_s] }
      match { |value| value.is_a?(Symbol) }
    end
</pre>
<p>
Now use it like this:
</p>
<pre>
    find(:post_123)
</pre>
<p>
This :id selector is already built into <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> by default, so you don&#8217;t
need to add it yourself.
</p>
<h2>Beware the XPath // trap</h2>
<p>
In XPath the expression // means something very specific, and it might not
be what you think. Contrary to common belief, // means &#8220;anywhere in
the document&#8221; not &#8220;anywhere in the current context&#8221;. As
an example:
</p>
<pre>
    page.find(:xpath, '//body').all(:xpath, '//script')
</pre>
<p>
You might expect this to find all script tags in the body, but actually, it
finds all script tags in the entire document, not only those in the body!
What you&#8217;re looking for is the .// expression which means &#8220;any
descendant of the current node&#8221;:
</p>
<pre>
    page.find(:xpath, '//body').all(:xpath, './/script')
</pre>
<p>
The same thing goes for within:
</p>
<pre>
    within(:xpath, '//body') do
      page.find(:xpath, './/script')
      within(:xpath, './/table/tbody') do
        ...
      end
    end
</pre>
<h2>Configuring and adding drivers</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> makes it convenient to
switch between different drivers. It also exposes an API to tweak those
drivers with whatever settings you want, or to add your own drivers. This
is how to switch the selenium driver to use chrome:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
      Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser =&gt; :chrome)
    end
</pre>
<p>
However, it&#8217;s also possible to give this a different name, so tests
can switch between using different browsers effortlessly:
</p>
<pre>
    Capybara.register_driver :selenium_chrome do |app|
      Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser =&gt; :chrome)
    end
</pre>
<p>
Whatever is returned from the block should conform to the API described by
<a href="../classes/Capybara/Driver/Base.html">Capybara::Driver::Base</a>,
it does not however have to inherit from this class. Gems can use this API
to add their own drivers to <a
href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings">Selenium
wiki</a> has additional info about how the underlying driver can be
configured.
</p>
<h2>Gotchas:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access to session and request is not possible from the test, Access to
response is limited. Some drivers allow access to response headers and HTTP
status code, but this kind of functionality is not provided by some
drivers, such as Selenium.

</li>
<li>Access to Rails specific stuff (such as <tt>controller</tt>) is
unavailable, since we&#8217;re not using Rails&#8217; integration testing.

</li>
<li>Freezing time: It&#8217;s common practice to mock out the Time so that
features that depend on the current Date work as expected. This can be
problematic, since Capybara&#8217;s Ajax timing uses the system time,
resulting in <a href="../classes/Capybara.html">Capybara</a> never timing
out and just hanging when a failure occurs. It&#8217;s still possible to
use plugins which allow you to travel in time, rather than freeze time. One
such plugin is <a href="http://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop">Timecop</a>.

</li>
<li>When using Rack::Test, beware if attempting to visit absolute URLs. For
example, a session might not be shared between visits to
<tt>posts_path</tt> and <tt>posts_url</tt>. If testing an absolute URL in
an Action Mailer email, set <tt>default_url_options</tt> to match the Rails
default of <tt><a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a></tt>.

</li>
</ul>
