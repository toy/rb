## 2.9.0 / September 24 2011
</p>
<p>
A vairly heavy release, including some new features which most of you
won&#8217;t need, but power users have contributed, this also marks the
beginning of the end of the 2.x series, more information will follow in due
course, but with the proliferation of Bundler, and better ways to do
deployment, we will be introducing heavier changes to <a
href="../classes/Capistrano.html">Capistrano</a> to keep the tool current.
</p>
<p>
**Please note, following some reported problems with the asset pipeline
code being not found, remember <a
href="../classes/Capistrano.html">Capistrano</a> needs to be in your
Gemfile, and as such needs to be run with Bundler, otherwise you risk
loading a system-wide version of <a
href="../classes/Capistrano.html">Capistrano</a> who&#8217;s behaviour
might be different from that specified in your Gemfile. This is also good
practice because much of the deploy logic resides in the Gem, and you
wouldn&#8217;t want that to change without your knowledge. Rails
applications include Cap in the Gemfile anyway, you should follow this
convention.**
</p>
<ul>
<li>find_servers() will no longer raise if there are no servers, this behaviour

</li>
</ul>
<p>
can be modified by way of the `:on_no_matching_servers` option. Thanks to
`@ppgengler`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Short Git SHA1 fragments are now supported in commands such as `cap deploy

</li>
</ul>
<p>
-s revision=d7e99f` thanks to `@ndbroadbent`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>One can now specify individual SCM commands by setting

</li>
</ul>
<p>
`:scm_arguments_<command_name>`. Thanks to `@alextk`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Travis CI build now passes thanks to @andrew, build tested against MRI

</li>
</ul>
<p>
`1.8.7`. `1.9.2` and `REE`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Perforce labels, I don&#8217;t know much about this, but I
believe

</li>
</ul>
<p>
it&#8217;s much like deploying a Git tag, thanks to `@ak47`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Git SCM now correctly adheres to the `:scm_verbose` setting. Thanks

</li>
</ul>
<p>
`@dubek`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>`set()` can now be used to set a `false` value, previously this was a
no-op.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks to `@nilbus`.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Git 1.6x submodules, The Git SCM strategy now queries Git on
the

</li>
</ul>
<p>
server-side to ensure it supports the `&#8212;recursive` flag, if it
doesn&#8217;t then it will fall back to using the long-hand. Many thanks to
all those involved in the discussion surrounding this topic, and to
`@nilbus` for a beautifully clean solution which doesn&#8217;t hold us
back.
</p>
<ul>
<li>When using `:cached_copy` with Subversion, use `svn switch` to for more

</li>
</ul>
<p>
reliable switching of branches/etc. Thanks to `@iGEL` for the patch that we
accepted finally, and to `@richmeyers` who also submitted a patch and
contributed to the discssion.
</p>
<p>
Other cleanups and minor improvements to the code and tests were committed
by yours truly (@leehambley), @maxim, @ak47 and @andrew).
</p>
<p>
## 2.8.0 / August 3 2011
</p>
<p>
A short release, after the last. Announcing Rails 3.1 asset pipeline
support.
</p>
<p>
The asset pipeline support requires an additiona `load` in your `Capfile`.
</p>
<p>
You can see information pertaining to the pull request, including the
inline comments here: <a
href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/pull/35">github.com/capistrano/capistrano/pull/35</a>
</p>
<p>
Documentation will be available soon in the wiki.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop-In Rails 3.1 asset pipeline support. (Chris Griego)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 2.7.0 / August 3 2011
</p>
<p>
A fairly substantial release. There are fixes so that current_release works
during dry-runs, (although, apparently still not with bundler.)
</p>
<p>
The test-suite was also modified to work with Ruby 1.9.2, except in one
case where Ruby 1.9.x calls `to_ary` and `to_a` on mocks, which still makes
an error. 1.9.x has always been supported, but due to lack of maintenance
on my part the tests didn&#8217;t ever pass.
</p>
<p>
The `start`, `stop` and `restart` tasks have been reduced to mere hooks
into which extensions can define their own functionality.
</p>
<p>
The `readme` was also slightly improved, simply tweaks to express how best
to run the test suite.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure dry-run works with `:current_release` variable (Carol Nichols)

</li>
<li>Added a new variable `:git_submodules_recursive`, setting the value to
false

</li>
</ul>
<p>
will ensure Git doesn&#8217;t recursively initialize and checkout
submodules. (Konstantin Kudryashov)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added an additional task option, `:on_no_matching_servers`, setting the

</li>
</ul>
<p>
value to `:continue` will ensure tasks with no matched servers continue
without error, instead of raising `Capistrano::NoMatchingServersError` as
was the previous behaviour. (Chris Griego)
</p>
<p>
A huge thanks to all contributors, as always!
</p>
<p>
Remember: @capistranorb on twitter for news.
</p>
<p>
## 2.6.1 / June 25 2011
</p>
<p>
A short maintenance release, Some fixes to the verbose flag inside the Git
SCM as well as another argument for the (internal) `variable()` command,
offering a default. The Git SCM is now verbose by default, but can be
disabled by setting `:scm_verbose` to false.
</p>
<p>
There has been an additional method added to string, within the context of
the test suite, I&#8217;m always sketchy about adding additional methods to
core classes, but it&#8217;s a short term fix until I make the time to
patch the test suite not to compare strings literally. The method is `<a
href="../classes/String.html#M000171">String#compact</a>`, and is
implemented simply as `self.gsub(/s+/, &#8217; &#8217;)`.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s the run-down of changes, and their committers, as always - a
huge thank you to the community that continues to drive Capistrano&#8217;s
development.
</p>
<ul>
<li>`deploy:setup` now respects `:group_writable` (Daniel Duvall)

</li>
<li>Fixes to `:scm_verbose` for the Git module (defaults to On.) (Matthew
Davies)

</li>
<li>Will now copy hidden files in the project&#8217;s root into the release

</li>
</ul>
<p>
directory (Mark Jaquith)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Now handles closing already-dead connections in a sane way (does not raise

</li>
</ul>
<p>
an exception) (Will Bryant)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Renamed `Capistrano::VERSION::TINY` to `Capistrano::VERSION::PATCH` (Lee

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hambley)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the `VERSION` file (Lee Hambley)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 2.6.0 / May 3 2011
</p>
<p>
A rather large release, feature-version bump because of the new
multiple-gateways feature as implemented by Ryan Duryea (way to go!)
</p>
<p>
Please also note from this release that if you use Git submodules, the
Git-version requirement for the new implementation is now >= 1.5.6, from
previously un-documented. (1.5.6 is new-enough that I think this is
acceptable)
</p>
<pre>
        * Upgrade Net::SSH-gateway dependency to 1.1 (fixes a thread-deadlocking bug on MRI    1.9)
        * Respect &quot;dry-run&quot; on transfer methods (Florian Frank)
        * Add support for multiple gateways: (Ryan Duryea)
        set :gateway, {
          'gate1.example.com' =&gt; 'server1.example.com',
          [ 'gate2.example.com', 'gate3.example.com' ] =&gt; [ 'server5.example.com', 'server6.example.com' ]
        }
        * Properly support nested Git submodules, moves Git requirement to &gt;= 1.5.6 [if        you rely upon submodules] (Ken Miller)
  * Fetch tags into the remote cache, allows deploying a tag when using Git, with the remote_cache strategy (Florian Frank)
  * Various fixes to path handling bugs in the copt strategy. (Philippe Rathé)
</pre>
<p>
## 2.5.21 / April 6 2011
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
## 2.5.20 / March 16 2011
</p>
<pre>
  * `deploy:migrations` will now always operate on the latest_release, not
        current_release (Mike Vincent)
  * Adds a check for the presence of `rsync` when using the copy strategy with `rsync`. (Chris Griego)
  * Do not try to look up the `:release_path` on servers which are defined `:no_release` (Chris Griego)
  * Tiny patch to the `CVS` SCM code to be Ruby 1.9 compatible (Martin Carpenter)
  * Changed the default `Git` submodule behaviour to use `--recursive`, Lighthouse Issue #176. (Lee Hambley)
  * `:public_children` can now be `set()`, the default is unchanged, thanks (Chris Griego)
  * Fixing the load path in the default `Capfile` to search vendored/unpacked Gems. Lighthouse Issue #174 (Mari Carmen/Rafael García)
  * Adds a `maintenance_basename` variable (default value is `maintenance`) to allow you to set the maintenance page name (Celestino Gomes)
  * Spelling fixes in inline-documentation (Tom Copeland)
  * Make `zip` and `tar` handle symlinks the same way (zip follows symlinks by default, tar needs the option `-h`) (Ross Cooperman)
</pre>
<p>
## 2.5.19 / June 21, 2010
</p>
<pre>
  * Small bug fixes, no improvements for people who weren't experiencing problems anyway.
</pre>
<p>
## 2.5.18 / March 14, 2010
</p>
<p>
Small fix for rolling back if a shell scripts exits non-zero; enabled a
rollback if git (or other) externals fail during the deploy.
</p>
<pre>

<p>
