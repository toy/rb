<hr size="1"></hr><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
dRuby is a distributed object system for Ruby. It is written in pure Ruby
and uses its own protocol. No add-in services are needed beyond those
provided by the Ruby runtime, such as TCP sockets. It does not rely on or
interoperate with other distributed object systems such as CORBA, RMI, or
.NET.
</p>
<p>
dRuby allows methods to be called in one Ruby process upon a Ruby object
located in another Ruby process, even on another machine. References to
objects can be passed between processes. <a
href="../../../classes/Method.html">Method</a> arguments and return values
are dumped and loaded in marshalled format. All of this is done
transparently to both the caller of the remote method and the object that
it is called upon.
</p>
<p>
An object in a remote process is locally represented by a <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbObject.html">DRb::DRbObject</a> instance.
This acts as a sort of proxy for the remote object. Methods called upon
this DRbObject instance are forwarded to its remote object. This is
arranged dynamically at run time. There are no statically declared
interfaces for remote objects, such as CORBA&#8217;s IDL.
</p>
<p>
dRuby calls made into a process are handled by a <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbServer.html">DRb::DRbServer</a> instance
within that process. This reconstitutes the method call, invokes it upon
the specified local object, and returns the value to the remote caller. Any
object can receive calls over dRuby. There is no need to implement a
special interface, or mixin special functionality. Nor, in the general
case, does an object need to explicitly register itself with a DRbServer in
order to receive dRuby calls.
</p>
<p>
One process wishing to make dRuby calls upon another process must somehow
obtain an initial reference to an object in the remote process by some
means other than as the return value of a remote method call, as there is
initially no remote object reference it can invoke a method upon. This is
done by attaching to the server by <a
href="../../../classes/URI.html">URI</a>. Each DRbServer binds itself to a
<a href="../../../classes/URI.html">URI</a> such as
&#8216;druby://example.com:8787&#8217;. A DRbServer can have an object
attached to it that acts as the server&#8217;s <b>front</b> <b>object</b>.
A DRbObject can be explicitly created from the server&#8217;s <a
href="../../../classes/URI.html">URI</a>. This DRbObject&#8217;s remote
object will be the server&#8217;s front object. This front object can then
return references to other Ruby objects in the DRbServer&#8217;s process.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Method.html">Method</a> calls made over dRuby
behave largely the same as normal Ruby method calls made within a process.
<a href="../../../classes/Method.html">Method</a> calls with blocks are
supported, as are raising exceptions. In addition to a method&#8217;s
standard errors, a dRuby call may also raise one of the dRuby-specific
errors, all of which are subclasses of <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbError.html">DRb::DRbError</a>.
</p>
<p>
Any type of object can be passed as an argument to a dRuby call or returned
as its return value. By default, such objects are dumped or marshalled at
the local end, then loaded or unmarshalled at the remote end. The remote
end therefore receives a copy of the local object, not a distributed
reference to it; methods invoked upon this copy are executed entirely in
the remote process, not passed on to the local original. This has semantics
similar to pass-by-value.
</p>
<p>
However, if an object cannot be marshalled, a dRuby reference to it is
passed or returned instead. This will turn up at the remote end as a
DRbObject instance. All methods invoked upon this remote proxy are
forwarded to the local object, as described in the discussion of
DRbObjects. This has semantics similar to the normal Ruby
pass-by-reference.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to signal that we want an otherwise marshallable object to
be passed or returned as a DRbObject reference, rather than marshalled and
sent as a copy, is to include the <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbUndumped.html">DRb::DRbUndumped</a> mixin
module.
</p>
<p>
dRuby supports calling remote methods with blocks. As blocks (or rather the
<a href="../../../classes/Proc.html">Proc</a> objects that represent them)
are not marshallable, the block executes in the local, not the remote,
context. Each value yielded to the block is passed from the remote object
to the local block, then the value returned by each block invocation is
passed back to the remote execution context to be collected, before the
collected values are finally returned to the local context as the return
value of the method invocation.
</p>
<h2>Examples of usage</h2>
<p>
For more dRuby samples, see the <tt>samples</tt> directory in the full
dRuby distribution.
</p>
<h3>dRuby in client/server mode</h3>
<p>
This illustrates setting up a simple client-server drb system. Run the
server and client code in different terminals, starting the server code
first.
</p>
<h4>Server code</h4>
<pre>
  require 'drb/drb'

  # The URI for the server to connect to
  URI=&quot;druby://localhost:8787&quot;

  class TimeServer

    def get_current_time
      return Time.now
    end

  end

  # The object that handles requests on the server
  FRONT_OBJECT=TimeServer.new

  $SAFE = 1   # disable eval() and friends

  DRb.start_service(URI, FRONT_OBJECT)
  # Wait for the drb server thread to finish before exiting.
  DRb.thread.join
</pre>
<h4>Client code</h4>
<pre>
  require 'drb/drb'

  # The URI to connect to
  SERVER_URI=&quot;druby://localhost:8787&quot;

  # Start a local DRbServer to handle callbacks.
  #
  # Not necessary for this small example, but will be required
  # as soon as we pass a non-marshallable object as an argument
  # to a dRuby call.
  DRb.start_service

  timeserver = DRbObject.new_with_uri(SERVER_URI)
  puts timeserver.get_current_time
</pre>
<h3>Remote objects under dRuby</h3>
<p>
This example illustrates returning a reference to an object from a dRuby
call. The <a href="../../../classes/Logger.html">Logger</a> instances live
in the server process. References to them are returned to the client
process, where methods can be invoked upon them. These methods are executed
in the server process.
</p>
<h4>Server code</h4>
<pre>
  require 'drb/drb'

  URI=&quot;druby://localhost:8787&quot;

  class Logger

      # Make dRuby send Logger instances as dRuby references,
      # not copies.
      include DRb::DRbUndumped

      def initialize(n, fname)
          @name = n
          @filename = fname
      end

      def log(message)
          File.open(@filename, &quot;a&quot;) do |f|
              f.puts(&quot;#{Time.now}: #{@name}: #{message}&quot;)
          end
      end

  end

  # We have a central object for creating and retrieving loggers.
  # This retains a local reference to all loggers created.  This
  # is so an existing logger can be looked up by name, but also
  # to prevent loggers from being garbage collected.  A dRuby
  # reference to an object is not sufficient to prevent it being
  # garbage collected!
  class LoggerFactory

      def initialize(bdir)
          @basedir = bdir
          @loggers = {}
      end

      def get_logger(name)
          if !@loggers.has_key? name
              # make the filename safe, then declare it to be so
              fname = name.gsub(/[.\/]/, &quot;_&quot;).untaint
              @loggers[name] = Logger.new(name, @basedir + &quot;/&quot; + fname)
          end
          return @loggers[name]
      end

  end

  FRONT_OBJECT=LoggerFactory.new(&quot;/tmp/dlog&quot;)

  $SAFE = 1   # disable eval() and friends

  DRb.start_service(URI, FRONT_OBJECT)
  DRb.thread.join
</pre>
<h4>Client code</h4>
<pre>
  require 'drb/drb'

  SERVER_URI=&quot;druby://localhost:8787&quot;

  DRb.start_service

  log_service=DRbObject.new_with_uri(SERVER_URI)

  [&quot;loga&quot;, &quot;logb&quot;, &quot;logc&quot;].each do |logname|

      logger=log_service.get_logger(logname)

      logger.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
      logger.log(&quot;Goodbye, world!&quot;)
      logger.log(&quot;=== EOT ===&quot;)

  end
</pre>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
As with all network services, security needs to be considered when using
dRuby. By allowing external access to a Ruby object, you are not only
allowing outside clients to call the methods you have defined for that
object, but by default to execute arbitrary Ruby code on your server.
Consider the following:
</p>
<pre>
   # !!! UNSAFE CODE !!!
   ro = DRbObject::new_with_uri(&quot;druby://your.server.com:8989&quot;)
   class &lt;&lt; ro
     undef :instance_eval  # force call to be passed to remote object
   end
   ro.instance_eval(&quot;`rm -rf *`&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
The dangers posed by instance_eval and friends are such that a DRbServer
should generally be run with $SAFE set to at least level 1. This will
disable eval() and related calls on strings passed across the wire. The
sample usage code given above follows this practice.
</p>
<p>
A DRbServer can be configured with an access control list to selectively
allow or deny access from specified IP addresses. The main druby
distribution provides the <a href="../../../classes/ACL.html">ACL</a> class
for this purpose. In general, this mechanism should only be used alongside,
rather than as a replacement for, a good firewall.
</p>
<h2>dRuby internals</h2>
<p>
dRuby is implemented using three main components: a remote method call
marshaller/unmarshaller; a transport protocol; and an ID-to-object mapper.
The latter two can be directly, and the first indirectly, replaced, in
order to provide different behaviour and capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Marshalling and unmarshalling of remote method calls is performed by a <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbMessage.html">DRb::DRbMessage</a> instance.
This uses the <a href="../../../classes/Marshal.html">Marshal</a> module to
dump the method call before sending it over the transport layer, then
reconstitute it at the other end. There is normally no need to replace this
component, and no direct way is provided to do so. However, it is possible
to implement an alternative marshalling scheme as part of an implementation
of the transport layer.
</p>
<p>
The transport layer is responsible for opening client and server network
connections and forwarding dRuby request across them. Normally, it uses <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbMessage.html">DRb::DRbMessage</a> internally
to manage marshalling and unmarshalling. The transport layer is managed by
<a href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbProtocol.html">DRb::DRbProtocol</a>.
Multiple protocols can be installed in DRbProtocol at the one time;
selection between them is determined by the scheme of a dRuby <a
href="../../../classes/URI.html">URI</a>. The default transport protocol is
selected by the scheme &#8216;druby:&#8217;, and implemented by <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbTCPSocket.html">DRb::DRbTCPSocket</a>. This
uses plain TCP/IP sockets for communication. An alternative protocol, using
UNIX domain sockets, is implemented by <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbUNIXSocket.html">DRb::DRbUNIXSocket</a> in
the file drb/unix.rb, and selected by the scheme &#8216;drbunix:&#8217;. A
sample implementation over HTTP can be found in the samples accompanying
the main dRuby distribution.
</p>
<p>
The ID-to-object mapping component maps dRuby object ids to the objects
they refer to, and vice versa. The implementation to use can be specified
as part of a DRb::DRbServer&#8217;s configuration. The default
implementation is provided by <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/DRbIdConv.html">DRb::DRbIdConv</a>. It uses an
object&#8217;s <a href="../../../classes/ObjectSpace.html">ObjectSpace</a>
id as its dRuby id. This means that the dRuby reference to that object only
remains meaningful for the lifetime of the object&#8217;s process and the
lifetime of the object within that process. A modified implementation is
provided by <a
href="../../../classes/DRb/TimerIdConv.html">DRb::TimerIdConv</a> in the
file drb/timeridconv.rb. This implementation retains a local reference to
all objects exported over dRuby for a configurable period of time
(defaulting to ten minutes), to prevent them being garbage-collected within
this time. Another sample implementation is provided in sample/name.rb in
the main dRuby distribution. This allows objects to specify their own id or
&#8220;name&#8221;. A dRuby reference can be made persistent across
processes by having each process register an object using the same dRuby
name.
