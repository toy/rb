<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Gem::Security implements cryptographic signatures in RubyGems. The section
below is a step-by-step guide to using signed gems and generating your own.
</p>
<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<p>
In order to start signing your gems, you&#8217;ll need to build a private
key and a self-signed certificate. Here&#8217;s how:
</p>
<pre>
  # build a private key and certificate for gemmaster@example.com
  $ gem cert --build gemmaster@example.com
</pre>
<p>
This could take anywhere from 5 seconds to 10 minutes, depending on the
speed of your computer (public key algorithms aren&#8217;t exactly the
speediest crypto algorithms in the world). When it&#8217;s finished,
you&#8217;ll see the files &#8220;gem-private_key.pem&#8220; and
&#8220;gem-public_cert.pem&#8220; in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
First things first: take the &#8220;gem-private_key.pem&#8220; file and
move it somewhere private, preferably a directory only you have access to,
a floppy (yuck!), a CD-ROM, or something comparably secure. Keep your
private key hidden; if it&#8217;s compromised, someone can sign packages as
you (note: PKI has ways of mitigating the risk of stolen keys; more on that
later).
</p>
<p>
Now, let&#8217;s sign an existing gem. I&#8217;ll be using my Imlib2-Ruby
bindings, but you can use whatever gem you&#8217;d like. Open up your
existing gemspec file and add the following lines:
</p>
<pre>
  # signing key and certificate chain
  s.signing_key = '/mnt/floppy/gem-private_key.pem'
  s.cert_chain  = ['gem-public_cert.pem']
</pre>
<p>
(Be sure to replace &#8220;/mnt/floppy&#8220; with the ultra-secret path to
your private key).
</p>
<p>
After that, go ahead and build your gem as usual. Congratulations,
you&#8217;ve just built your first signed gem! If you peek inside your gem
file, you&#8217;ll see a couple of new files have been added:
</p>
<pre>
  $ tar tf tar tf Imlib2-Ruby-0.5.0.gem
  data.tar.gz
  data.tar.gz.sig
  metadata.gz
  metadata.gz.sig
</pre>
<p>
Now let&#8217;s verify the signature. Go ahead and install the gem, but add
the following options: &#8220;-P HighSecurity&#8221;, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  # install the gem with using the security policy &quot;HighSecurity&quot;
  $ sudo gem install Imlib2-Ruby-0.5.0.gem -P HighSecurity
</pre>
<p>
The -P option sets your security policy &#8212; we&#8217;ll talk about that
in just a minute. Eh, what&#8217;s this?
</p>
<pre>
  Attempting local installation of 'Imlib2-Ruby-0.5.0.gem'
  ERROR:  Error installing gem Imlib2-Ruby-0.5.0.gem[.gem]: Couldn't
  verify data signature: Untrusted Signing Chain Root: cert =
  '/CN=gemmaster/DC=example/DC=com', error = 'path
  &quot;/root/.rubygems/trust/cert-15dbb43a6edf6a70a85d4e784e2e45312cff7030.pem&quot;
  does not exist'
</pre>
<p>
The culprit here is the security policy. RubyGems has several different
security policies. Let&#8217;s take a short break and go over the security
policies. Here&#8217;s a list of the available security policies, and a
brief description of each one:
</p>
<ul>
<li>NoSecurity - Well, no security at all. Signed packages are treated like
unsigned packages.

</li>
<li>LowSecurity - Pretty much no security. If a package is signed then RubyGems
will make sure the signature matches the signing certificate, and that the
signing certificate hasn&#8217;t expired, but that&#8217;s it. A malicious
user could easily circumvent this kind of security.

</li>
<li>MediumSecurity - Better than LowSecurity and NoSecurity, but still
fallible. <a href="Package.html">Package</a> contents are verified against
the signing certificate, and the signing certificate is checked for
validity, and checked against the rest of the certificate chain (if you
don&#8217;t know what a certificate chain is, stay tuned, we&#8217;ll get
to that). The biggest improvement over LowSecurity is that MediumSecurity
won&#8217;t install packages that are signed by untrusted sources.
Unfortunately, MediumSecurity still isn&#8217;t totally secure &#8212; a
malicious user can still unpack the gem, strip the signatures, and
distribute the gem unsigned.

</li>
<li>HighSecurity - Here&#8217;s the bugger that got us into this mess. The
HighSecurity policy is identical to the MediumSecurity policy, except that
it does not allow unsigned gems. A malicious user doesn&#8217;t have a
whole lot of options here; he can&#8217;t modify the package contents
without invalidating the signature, and he can&#8217;t modify or remove
signature or the signing certificate chain, or RubyGems will simply refuse
to install the package. Oh well, maybe he&#8217;ll have better luck causing
problems for CPAN users instead :).

</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, the reason RubyGems refused to install our shiny new signed gem was
because it was from an untrusted source. Well, my code is infallible
(hah!), so I&#8217;m going to add myself as a trusted source.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s how:
</p>
<pre>
    # add trusted certificate
    gem cert --add gem-public_cert.pem
</pre>
<p>
I&#8217;ve added my public certificate as a trusted source. Now I can
install packages signed my private key without any hassle. Let&#8217;s try
the install command above again:
</p>
<pre>
  # install the gem with using the HighSecurity policy (and this time
  # without any shenanigans)
  $ sudo gem install Imlib2-Ruby-0.5.0.gem -P HighSecurity
</pre>
<p>
This time RubyGems should accept your signed package and begin installing.
While you&#8217;re waiting for RubyGems to work it&#8217;s magic, have a
look at some of the other security commands:
</p>
<pre>
  Usage: gem cert [options]

  Options:
    -a, --add CERT          Add a trusted certificate.
    -l, --list              List trusted certificates.
    -r, --remove STRING     Remove trusted certificates containing STRING.
    -b, --build EMAIL_ADDR  Build private key and self-signed certificate
                            for EMAIL_ADDR.
    -C, --certificate CERT  Certificate for --sign command.
    -K, --private-key KEY   Private key for --sign command.
    -s, --sign NEWCERT      Sign a certificate with my key and certificate.
</pre>
<p>
(By the way, you can pull up this list any time you&#8217;d like by typing
&#8220;gem cert &#8212;help&#8221;)
</p>
<p>
Hmm. We&#8217;ve already covered the &#8220;&#8212;build&#8221; option, and
the &#8220;&#8212;add&#8221;, &#8220;&#8212;list&#8221;, and
&#8220;&#8212;remove&#8221; commands seem fairly straightforward; they
allow you to add, list, and remove the certificates in your trusted
certificate list. But what&#8217;s with this &#8220;&#8212;sign&#8221;
option?
</p>
<p>
To answer that question, let&#8217;s take a look at &#8220;certificate
chains&#8221;, a concept I mentioned earlier. There are a couple of
problems with self-signed certificates: first of all, self-signed
certificates don&#8217;t offer a whole lot of security. Sure, the
certificate says Yukihiro Matsumoto, but how do I know it was actually
generated and signed by matz himself unless he gave me the certificate in
person?
</p>
<p>
The second problem is scalability. Sure, if there are 50 gem authors, then
I have 50 trusted certificates, no problem. What if there are 500 gem
authors? 1000? Having to constantly add new trusted certificates is a pain,
and it actually makes the trust system less secure by encouraging RubyGems
users to blindly trust new certificates.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s where certificate chains come in. A certificate chain
establishes an arbitrarily long chain of trust between an issuing
certificate and a child certificate. So instead of trusting certificates on
a per-developer basis, we use the PKI concept of certificate chains to
build a logical hierarchy of trust. Here&#8217;s a hypothetical example of
a trust hierarchy based (roughly) on geography:
</p>
<pre>
                        --------------------------
                        | rubygems@rubyforge.org |
                        --------------------------
                                    |
                  -----------------------------------
                  |                                 |
      ----------------------------    -----------------------------
      | seattle.rb@zenspider.com |    | dcrubyists@richkilmer.com |
      ----------------------------    -----------------------------
           |                |                 |             |
    ---------------   ----------------   -----------   --------------
    | alf@seattle |   | bob@portland |   | pabs@dc |   | tomcope@dc |
    ---------------   ----------------   -----------   --------------
</pre>
<p>
Now, rather than having 4 trusted certificates (one for alf@seattle,
bob@portland, pabs@dc, and tomecope@dc), a user could actually get by with
1 certificate: the &#8220;rubygems@rubyforge.org&#8220; certificate.
Here&#8217;s how it works:
</p>
<p>
I install &#8220;Alf2000-Ruby-0.1.0.gem&#8220;, a package signed by
&#8220;alf@seattle&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never heard of
&#8220;alf@seattle&#8221;, but his certificate has a valid signature from
the &#8220;seattle.rb@zenspider.com&#8220; certificate, which in turn has a
valid signature from the &#8220;rubygems@rubyforge.org&#8220; certificate.
Voila! At this point, it&#8217;s much more reasonable for me to trust a
package signed by &#8220;alf@seattle&#8221;, because I can establish a
chain to &#8220;rubygems@rubyforge.org&#8220;, which I do trust.
</p>
<p>
And the &#8220;&#8212;sign&#8221; option allows all this to happen. A
developer creates their build certificate with the
&#8220;&#8212;build&#8221; option, then has their certificate signed by
taking it with them to their next regional Ruby meetup (in our hypothetical
example), and it&#8217;s signed there by the person holding the regional
RubyGems signing certificate, which is signed at the next RubyConf by the
holder of the top-level RubyGems certificate. At each point the issuer runs
the same command:
</p>
<pre>
  # sign a certificate with the specified key and certificate
  # (note that this modifies client_cert.pem!)
  $ gem cert -K /mnt/floppy/issuer-priv_key.pem -C issuer-pub_cert.pem
     --sign client_cert.pem
</pre>
<p>
Then the holder of issued certificate (in this case, our buddy
&#8220;alf@seattle&#8221;), can start using this signed certificate to sign
RubyGems. By the way, in order to let everyone else know about his new
fancy signed certificate, &#8220;alf@seattle&#8221; would change his
gemspec file to look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  # signing key (still kept in an undisclosed location!)
  s.signing_key = '/mnt/floppy/alf-private_key.pem'

  # certificate chain (includes the issuer certificate now too)
  s.cert_chain  = ['/home/alf/doc/seattlerb-public_cert.pem',
                   '/home/alf/doc/alf_at_seattle-public_cert.pem']
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, this RubyGems trust infrastructure doesn&#8217;t exist yet.
Also, in the &#8220;real world&#8221; issuers actually generate the child
certificate from a certificate request, rather than sign an existing
certificate. And our hypothetical infrastructure is missing a certificate
revocation system. These are that can be fixed in the future...
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m sure your new signed gem has finished installing by now (unless
you&#8217;re installing rails and all it&#8217;s dependencies, that is ;D).
At this point you should know how to do all of these new and interesting
things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>build a gem signing key and certificate

</li>
<li>modify your existing gems to support signing

</li>
<li>adjust your security policy

</li>
<li>modify your trusted certificate list

</li>
<li>sign a certificate

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Command-Line Options</h2>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a brief summary of the certificate-related command line
options:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install
    -P, --trust-policy POLICY        Specify gem trust policy.

  gem cert
    -a, --add CERT                   Add a trusted certificate.
    -l, --list                       List trusted certificates.
    -r, --remove STRING              Remove trusted certificates containing
                                     STRING.
    -b, --build EMAIL_ADDR           Build private key and self-signed
                                     certificate for EMAIL_ADDR.
    -C, --certificate CERT           Certificate for --sign command.
    -K, --private-key KEY            Private key for --sign command.
    -s, --sign NEWCERT               Sign a certificate with my key and
                                     certificate.
</pre>
<p>
A more detailed description of each options is available in the walkthrough
above.
</p>
<h2>Manually verifying signatures</h2>
<p>
In case you don&#8217;t trust RubyGems you can verify gem signatures
manually:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch and unpack the gem

<pre>
 gem fetch some_signed_gem
 tar -xf some_signed_gem-1.0.gem
</pre>
</li>
<li>Grab the public key from the gemspec

<pre>
 gem spec some_signed_gem-1.0.gem cert_chain |  #       ruby -pe 'sub(/^ +/, &quot;&quot;)' &gt; public_key.crt
</pre>
</li>
<li>Generate a SHA1 hash of the data.tar.gz

<pre>
 openssl dgst -sha1 &lt; data.tar.gz &gt; my.hash
</pre>
</li>
<li>Verify the signature

<pre>
 openssl rsautl -verify -inkey public_key.crt -certin  #       -in data.tar.gz.sig &gt; verified.hash
</pre>
</li>
<li>Compare your hash to the verified hash

<pre>
 diff -s verified.hash my.hash
</pre>
</li>
<li>Repeat 5 and 6 with metadata.gz

</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="../OpenSSL.html">OpenSSL</a> Reference</h2>
<p>
The .pem files generated by &#8212;build and &#8212;sign are just basic <a
href="../OpenSSL.html">OpenSSL</a> PEM files. Here&#8217;s a couple of
useful commands for manipulating them:
</p>
<pre>
  # convert a PEM format X509 certificate into DER format:
  # (note: Windows .cer files are X509 certificates in DER format)
  $ openssl x509 -in input.pem -outform der -out output.der

  # print out the certificate in a human-readable format:
  $ openssl x509 -in input.pem -noout -text
</pre>
<p>
And you can do the same thing with the private key file as well:
</p>
<pre>
  # convert a PEM format RSA key into DER format:
  $ openssl rsa -in input_key.pem -outform der -out output_key.der

  # print out the key in a human readable format:
  $ openssl rsa -in input_key.pem -noout -text
</pre>
<h2>Bugs/TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s no way to define a system-wide trust list.

</li>
<li>custom security policies (from a <a href="../YAML.html">YAML</a> file, etc)

</li>
<li>Simple method to generate a signed certificate request

</li>
<li>Support for OCSP, SCVP, CRLs, or some other form of cert status check (list
is in order of preference)

</li>
<li>Support for encrypted private keys

</li>
<li>Some sort of semi-formal trust hierarchy (see long-winded explanation
above)

</li>
<li>Path discovery (for gem certificate chains that don&#8217;t have a
self-signed root) &#8212; by the way, since we don&#8217;t have this, THE
ROOT OF THE CERTIFICATE CHAIN MUST BE SELF SIGNED if Policy#verify_root is
true (and it is for the MediumSecurity and HighSecurity policies)

</li>
<li>Better explanation of X509 naming (ie, we don&#8217;t have to use email
addresses)

</li>
<li>Possible alternate signing mechanisms (eg, via PGP). this could be done
pretty easily by adding a :signing_type attribute to the gemspec, then add
the necessary support in other places

</li>
<li>Honor AIA field (see note about OCSP above)

</li>
<li>Maybe honor restriction extensions?

</li>
<li>Might be better to store the certificate chain as a PKCS#7 or PKCS#12 file,
instead of an array embedded in the metadata. ideas?

</li>
<li>Possibly embed signature and key algorithms into metadata (right now
they&#8217;re assumed to be the same as what&#8217;s set in
Gem::Security::OPT)

</li>
</ul>
