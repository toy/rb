<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/ZenTest.html">ZenTest</a> provides 4 different tools:
zentest, unit_diff, autotest, and multiruby.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/ZenTest.html">ZenTest</a> scans your target and
unit-test code and writes your missing code based on simple naming rules,
enabling XP at a much quicker pace. <a
href="../classes/ZenTest.html">ZenTest</a> only works with Ruby and
Test::Unit. Nobody uses this tool anymore but it is the package namesake,
so it stays.
</p>
<p>
unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from actual
results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong. Do note that
minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating the need for
unit_diff
</p>
<p>
autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.
</p>
<p>
multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great for
compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your installed
versions.
</p>
<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scans your ruby code and tests and generates missing methods for you.

</li>
<li>Includes a very helpful filter for Test/Spec output called unit_diff.

</li>
<li>Continually and intelligently test only those files you change with
autotest.

</li>
<li>Test against multiple versions with multiruby.

</li>
<li>Includes a LinuxJournal article on testing with <a
href="../classes/ZenTest.html">ZenTest</a> written by Pat Eyler.

<h2>STRATEGERY</h2>
<p>
There are two strategeries intended for ZenTest: test conformance auditing
and rapid XP.
</p>
<p>
For auditing, <a href="../classes/ZenTest.html">ZenTest</a> provides an
excellent means of finding methods that have slipped through the testing
process. I&#8217;ve run it against my own software and found I missed a lot
in a well tested package. Writing those tests found 4 bugs I had no idea
existed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/ZenTest.html">ZenTest</a> can also be used to evaluate
generated code and execute your tests, allowing for very rapid development
of both tests and implementation.
</p>
<h2>AUTOTEST TIPS</h2>
<p>
Setting up your project with a custom setup is easily done by creating a
&#8220;.autotest&#8221; file in your project. Here is an example of adding
some plugins, using minitest as your test library, and running rcov on full
passes:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'autotest/restart'

    Autotest.add_hook :initialize do |at|
      at.testlib = &quot;minitest/autorun&quot;
    end

    Autotest.add_hook :all_good do |at|
      system &quot;rake rcov_info&quot;
    end if ENV['RCOV']
</pre>
<p>
Do note, since minitest ships with ruby19, if you want to use the latest
minitest gem you need to ensure that the gem activation occurs! To do this,
add the gem activation and the proper require to a separate file (like
&#8220;.minitest.rb&#8220; or even a test helper if you have one) and use
that for your testlib instead:
</p>
<p>
.minitest.rb:
</p>
<pre>
    gem &quot;minitest&quot;
    require &quot;minitest/autorun&quot;
</pre>
<p>
.autotest:
</p>
<pre>
    Autotest.add_hook :initialize do |at|
      at.testlib = &quot;.minitest&quot;
    end
</pre>
