</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> is a templating engine for HTML.
It&#8217;s are designed to make it both easier and more pleasant to write
HTML documents, by eliminating redundancy, reflecting the underlying
structure that the document represents, and providing elegant, easily
understandable, and powerful syntax.
</p>
<p>
## Using
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> can be used from the command line
or as part of a Ruby web framework. The first step is to install the gem:
</p>
<pre>
    gem install haml
</pre>
<p>
After you convert some HTML to <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>, you
can run
</p>
<pre>
    haml document.haml
</pre>
<p>
to compile them. For more information on these commands, check out
</p>
<pre>
    haml --help
</pre>
<p>
To install <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> in Rails 2, just add
`config.gem &#8220;haml&#8221;` to `config/environment.rb`. In Rails 3, add
`gem &#8220;haml&#8221;` to your Gemfile instead. and both <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and Sass will be installed. Views with
the `.html.haml` extension will automatically use <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>.
</p>
<p>
To use <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> programatically, check out
the [YARD documentation](<a
href="http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/">haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/</a>).
</p>
<p>
## Formatting
</p>
<p>
The most basic element of <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> is a
shorthand for creating HTML:
</p>
<pre>
    %tagname{:attr1 =&gt; 'value1', :attr2 =&gt; 'value2'} Contents
</pre>
<p>
No end-tag is needed; <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> handles that
automatically. If you prefer HTML-style attributes, you can also use:
</p>
<pre>
    %tagname(attr1='value1' attr2='value2') Contents
</pre>
<p>
Adding `class` and `id` attributes is even easier. <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> uses the same syntax as the CSS that
styles the document:
</p>
<pre>
    %tagname#id.class
</pre>
<p>
In fact, when you&#8217;re using the `<div>` tag, it becomes _even easier_.
Because `<div>` is such a common element, a tag without a name defaults to
a div. So
</p>
<pre>
    #foo Hello!
</pre>
<p>
becomes
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;div id='foo'&gt;Hello!&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> uses indentation to bring the
individual elements to represent the HTML structure. A tag&#8217;s children
are indented beneath than the parent tag. Again, a closing tag is
automatically added. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    %ul
      %li Salt
      %li Pepper
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You can also put plain text as a child of an element:
</p>
<pre>
    %p
      Hello,
      World!
</pre>
<p>
It&#8217;s also possible to embed Ruby code into <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> documents. An equals sign, `=`, will
output the result of the code. A hyphen, `-`, will run the code but not
output the result. You can even use control statements like `if` and
`while`:
</p>
<pre>
    %p
      Date/Time:
      - now = DateTime.now
      %strong= now
      - if now &gt; DateTime.parse(&quot;December 31, 2006&quot;)
        = &quot;Happy new &quot; + &quot;year!&quot;
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> provides far more tools than those
presented here. Check out the [reference documentation](<a
href="http://beta.haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html">beta.haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html</a>)
for full details.
</p>
<p>
### Indentation
</p>
<p>
Haml&#8217;s indentation can be made up of one or more tabs or spaces.
However, indentation must be consistent within a given document. Hard tabs
and spaces can&#8217;t be mixed, and the same number of tabs or spaces must
be used throughout.

## Authors
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> was created by [Hampton Catlin](<a
href="http://hamptoncatlin.com">hamptoncatlin.com</a>) (hcatlin) and he is
the author of the original implementation. However, Hampton doesn&#8217;t
even know his way around the code anymore and now occasionally consults on
the language issues. Hampton lives in Jacksonville, Florida and is the lead
mobile developer for Wikimedia.
</p>
<p>
[Nathan Weizenbaum](<a href="http://nex-3.com">nex-3.com</a>) is the
primary developer and architect of the &#8220;modern&#8221; Ruby
implementation of <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>. His hard work
has kept the project alive by endlessly answering forum posts, fixing bugs,
refactoring, finding speed improvements, writing documentation,
implementing new features, and getting Hampton coffee (a fitting task for a
boy-genius). Nathan lives in Seattle, Washington and while not being a
student at the University of Washington or working at an internship, he
consults for Unspace Interactive.
</p>
<p>
If you use this software, you must pay Hampton a compliment. And buy Nathan
some jelly beans. Maybe pet a kitten. Yeah. Pet that kitty.
</p>
<p>
Some of the work on <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> was supported
by Unspace Interactive.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, the implementation is licensed under the MIT License. Okay,
fine, I guess that means compliments aren&#8217;t <em>required</em>.
