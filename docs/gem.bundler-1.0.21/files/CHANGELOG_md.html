</pre>
<p>
## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)
</p>
<p>
Features:
</p>
<pre>
  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x

  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock
</pre>
<p>

<pre>
  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain
</pre>
<p>
## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)
</p>
<pre>
  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say &quot;the git source is not checked out&quot; when
    running `bundle install`
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: We received several reports of &#8220;the git source has not been
checked out. Please run bundle install&#8221;. As far as we can tell, these
problems have two possible causes:
</p>
<ol>
<li>`bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running the
application as another user. Never install gems to a directory scoped to a
user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.

</li>
<li>A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the new
`&#8212;production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of the best
practices we have been encouraging people to use for deployment.
</p>
<p>
If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use Capistrano,
symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to release_path/shared/bundle.
This will keep deployments snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean,
deploy-time isolation.
