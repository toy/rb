        <h1><a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> - Ruby Generator Framework</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drnic.github.com/rubigen">drnic.github.com/rubigen</a>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>
A framework to allow Ruby applications to generate file/folder stubs (like
the `rails` command does for Ruby on Rails, and the
&#8216;script/generate&#8217; command within a Rails application during
development).
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> is originally extracted from
Ruby on Rails (specifically the rails_generator from its railties gem).
</p>
<p>
The rails_generator was hardcoded with Rails-specific dependencies
(`RAILS_ROOT`), Rails generators (&#8216;app&#8217; = Rails application;
&#8216;model&#8217; = Rails model+tests+migration), and generally assumed
it was the only generator framework within the Ruby world (it was). So, any
RubyGem whose name ended with &#8216;_generator&#8217; was assumed to be a
generator for a Rails application.
</p>
<p>
But if you are developing an Adhearsion application, then you may want a
different set of generators. If you are developing a RubyGem, then you will
want a different set of generators.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> exists to give different
development environments their own generator framework.
</p>
<h3>Thanks go to...</h3>
<p>
Jeremy Kemper wrote the original Rails Generator, which is 95% of the basis
of <a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a>. He&#8217;s awesome.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> is only required at
development time, and normally isn&#8217;t required at deployment time
(unless your application uses it to generate files at runtime).
</p>
<p>
On your development machine:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo gem install rubigen
</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> comes with a stand-alone
executable to allow you to invoke generators:
</p>
<p>
For example, to run the rails&#8217; `model` generator:
</p>
<pre>
    rubigen rails model Person name:string
</pre>
<p>
would replace the normal
</p>
<pre>
    script/generate model Person name:string
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> has been traditionally
integrated into another project, such as `rails`, `newgem` or `camping`,
rather than be used on its own.
</p>
<p>
These frameworks might use <a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a>
for two reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>To generate an initial stub for developers, e.g. `rails` generated a stub
to write a Rails application. `newgem` generates a stub to write a RubyGem.
BTW - <a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> has a builtin
application `ruby_app` which generates a bare-bones Ruby application stub
(lib, test, and script folders, plus a Rakefile, and a script/generate
script)

</li>
<li>To generate components within their development areas, e.g. Rails had its
`script/generate` script within each Rails application, which hooked back
into the rails_generator to lookup and execute generators.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
So, there are two steps to integrating <a
href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> into your framework:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use it to generate an initial stub for the developers of your framework.
This would create the folders (`lib/app`, `test`, `script`, `doc`, `log`,
etc) and starting files (`Rakefile`, `README.txt`, `test/test_helper.rb`
etc). Importantly, it would generate a `script/generate` file. The
`script/generate` file (example below) will allow developers of your
framework to generate components/extensions within the framework. <a
href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a> allows you to restrict which
generators are available. For example, within RubyGem development
environment (as generated by `newgem`), the `script/generator` only shows
`rubygem`-related generators. Rails could restrict `script/generator` to
only show Rails related generators

</li>
<li>Your framework RubyGem (e.g. `newgem` or `rails`) needs to add `rubigen` as
a dependency, so that users of your RubyGem can access the generator
framework.

</li>
</ol>
<h1>Creating generators</h1>
<p>
There are two types of generators:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Application Generators - used by developers of your framework to get
started. Generally, you will create one Application Generator for your
framework. It generates a base stub (such as the `rails` stub for new Rails
applications) for your framework users.

</li>
<li>Component Generators - used by developers to extend their application. You
may include 1+ built-in generators with your framework. Developers can also
write generators for your framework, and like Rails&#8217; generator
install them in various places and have access to their via <a
href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a>.

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creating an Application Generator for your Framework</h2>
<p>
Without <a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a>, to give your users a
head start and create a stub for them, you will copiously use `mkdir_p` and
`File.open`. Your script will either be primitive (only create the bare
folders and very few files) or it will be very long and unreadable (ok,
perhaps I&#8217;m just talking about the `newgem` script, which I am
dubiously responsible for... :P).
</p>
<p>
With <a href="../classes/RubiGen.html">RubiGen</a>, you can create stubs
using powerful, yet simple, syntax. Templates are extracted into a
`templates` folder, and activating the generator from a script requires
only a few lines of code.
</p>
<p>
These are the `newgem` files related to its Application Generator.
</p>
<pre>
    bin/
      bin/newgem        # Application Generator script; Usage: newgem gemname [options]
    app_generators/
      app_generators/newgem/
        app_generators/newgem/newgem_generator.rb
        app_generators/newgem/USAGE
        app_generators/newgem/templates/
          app_generators/newgem/templates/app.rb
          app_generators/newgem/templates/History.txt
          app_generators/newgem/templates/... lots and lots of templates
</pre>
<p>
The `bin/newgem` script is very simple, and looks like:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'rubigen'

    if %w(-v --version).include? ARGV.first
      require 'newgem/version'
      puts &quot;#{File.basename($0)} #{Newgem::VERSION}&quot;
      exit(0)
    end

    require 'rubigen/scripts/generate'
    RubiGen::Base.use_application_sources!
    RubiGen::Scripts::Generate.new.run(ARGV, :generator =&gt; 'newgem')
</pre>
<p>
You can copy and paste this for your own generator script, and place it in
your RubyGem&#8217;s `bin` folder. Change `newgem` to your RubyGem&#8217;s
name in the script above (and in all the folders listed above too)
</p>
<p>
NOTE: If you leave `newgem` there, then it will execute the
`newgem_generator.rb` generator; as the generators are loaded from all
RubyGem&#8217;s having `/app_generators` folders.
</p>
<p>
So, for your RubyGem, you need to keep the `/app_generators` folder (as you
are creating an Application Generator, not a Component Generator), but
change `newgem` to `your gem name` in all the subfolders and files.
ESPECIALLY `newgem_generator.rb` -> `yourgem_generator.rb`, as this is how
the generator is discovered (via `RubiGen::Base.use_application_sources!`).
</p>
<p>
All the generator work is performed within `yourgem_generator.rb`. A stub
for it will be:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'rbconfig'

    class YourgemGenerator &lt; RubiGen::Base
      DEFAULT_SHEBANG = File.join(Config::CONFIG['bindir'],
                                  Config::CONFIG['ruby_install_name'])

      default_options   :shebang =&gt; DEFAULT_SHEBANG,
                        :an_option =&gt; 'some_default'

      attr_reader :app_name, :module_name

      def initialize(runtime_args, runtime_options = {})
        super
        usage if args.empty?
        @destination_root = args.shift
        @app_name     = File.basename(File.expand_path(@destination_root))
        @module_name  = app_name.camelize
        extract_options
      end

      def manifest
        # Use /usr/bin/env if no special shebang was specified
        script_options     = { :chmod =&gt; 0755, :shebang =&gt; options[:shebang] == DEFAULT_SHEBANG ? nil : options[:shebang] }
        windows            = (RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /dos|win32|cygwin/i) || (RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /(:?mswin|mingw)/)

        record do |m|
          # Root directory and all subdirectories.
          m.directory ''
          BASEDIRS.each { |path| m.directory path }

          # Root
          m.template_copy_each %w( Rakefile )
          m.file_copy_each     %w( README.txt )

          # Test helper
          m.template   &quot;test_helper.rb&quot;,        &quot;test/test_helper.rb&quot;

          # Scripts
          %w( generate ).each do |file|
            m.template &quot;script/#{file}&quot;,        &quot;script/#{file}&quot;, script_options
            m.template &quot;script/win_script.cmd&quot;, &quot;script/#{file}.cmd&quot;,
              :assigns =&gt; { :filename =&gt; file } if windows
          end

        end
      end

      protected
        def banner
          &lt;&lt;-EOS
    Create a stub for #{File.basename $0} to get started.

    Usage: #{File.basename $0} /path/to/your/app [options]&quot;
    EOS
        end

        def add_options!(opts)
          opts.separator ''
          opts.separator &quot;#{File.basename $0} options:&quot;
          opts.on(&quot;-v&quot;, &quot;--version&quot;, &quot;Show the #{File.basename($0)} version number and quit.&quot;)
        end

      # Installation skeleton.  Intermediate directories are automatically
      # created so don't sweat their absence here.
      BASEDIRS = %w(
        doc
        lib
        log
        script
        test
        tmp
      )
    end

<p>
Easy peasy.
