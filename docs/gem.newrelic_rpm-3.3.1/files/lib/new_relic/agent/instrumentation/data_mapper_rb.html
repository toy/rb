 NewRelic instrumentation for DataMapper
</pre>
<p>
Instrumenting DM has different key challenges versus AR:
</p>
<pre>
  1. The hooking of SQL logging in DM is decoupled from any knowledge of the
     Model#method that invoked it.  But on the positive side, the duration is
     already calculated for you (and it happens inside the C-based DO code, so
     it's faster than a Ruby equivalent).

  2. There are a lot more entry points that need to be hooked in order to
     understand call flow: DM::Model (model class) vs. DM::Resource (model
     instance) vs. DM::Collection (collection of model instances).  And
     others.

  3. Strategic Eager Loading (SEL) combined with separately-grouped
     lazy-loaded attributes presents a unique problem for tying resulting
     SEL-invoked SQL calls to their proper scope.

<p>
NOTE: On using &#8220;Database&#8221; versus &#8220;ActiveRecord&#8221; as
base metric name
</p>
<pre>
  Using &quot;Database&quot; as the metric name base seems to properly identify methods
  as being DB-related in call graphs, but certain New Relic views that show
  aggregations of DB CPM, etc still seem to rely solely on &quot;ActiveRecord&quot;
  being the base name, thus AFAICT &quot;Database&quot; calls to this are lost.  (Though
  I haven't yet tested &quot;Database/SQL/{find/save/destroy/all}&quot; yet, as it seems
  like an intuitively good name to use.)

  So far I think these are the rules:

    - ActiveRecord/{find/save/destroy} populates &quot;Database Throughput&quot; and
      &quot;Database Response Time&quot; in the Database tab. [non-scoped]

    - ActiveRecord/all populates the main Overview tab of DB time.  (still
      unsure about this one). [non-scoped]

    These metrics are represented as :push_scope =&gt; false or included as the
    non-first metric in trace_execution_scoped() (docs say only first counts
    towards scope) so they don't show up ine normal call graph/trace.
