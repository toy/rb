&#8220;ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO RUBY&#8220;
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Ruby <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> is the premiere collection
of general purpose method extensions and standard additions for the Ruby
programming language.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> houses the largest single
collection of methods available for extending the core capabilities of
Ruby&#8217;s built-in classes and modules. This collection of extension
methods are unique by virtue of their atomicity. The methods are stored in
individual files so that each can be required independently. This gives
developers the potential for much finer control over which extra methods to
bring into their code.
</p>
<p>
In addition <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> provides a
collection of extensions to Ruby standard library plus a small collection
of add-on classes and modules. Together these libraries constitute an
reliable source of reusable components, suitable to a wide variety of
usecases.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> has special documentation needs
due to it&#8217;s extensive bredth. The documentation generated when
installing via RubyGems, or the YARD docs provided by rubydoc.info can be
somewhat unweildly because it combines all of <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> in one large set. When using these
resources, it is important to remain aware of the source location of
particular methods.
</p>
<p>
For better organized online documentation, generated to separate core
extensions from standard libraries, see the <a
href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/learn.html">Learn Facets</a> page
on the website for links to available documentation.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>RubyGems</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.
</p>
<pre>
  $ gem install facets
</pre>
<h3>Setup.rb</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> can be installed the
old-fashioned way using Ruby Setup (<a
href="http://rubyworks.github.com/setup">rubyworks.github.com/setup</a>).
Download and unpack the .tar.gz package and run setup.rb, like so:
</p>
<pre>
  $ tar -xvzf facets-2.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd facets-2.x.x
  $ sudo setup.rb
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.8+ requires Ruby 1.8.7 or
higher.
</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> holds to the notion that the
more we can <b>reasonably</b> integrate into a common foundation, directed
toward general needs, the better that foundation will be able to serve the
community. There are a number of advantages here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Better Code-reuse

</li>
<li>Collaborative Improvements

</li>
<li>Greater Name Consistency

</li>
<li>One-stop Shop and Installation

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>CORE Library</h3>
<p>
At the heart of Ruby <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> is the
CORE extensions library. CORE provides a sizable collection of generally
useful methods, along with a few supporting classes, that extend the
functionality of Ruby&#8217;s core classes and modules.
</p>
<p>
With the exception of a few <b>uncommon</b> extensions, CORE contains
anything that will load automatically when issuing:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This loads all the CORE functionality at once. If you plan to use more then
a handful of <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> core methods it is
recommended that you require the library in this way. However, you can also
&#8220;cherry pick&#8221; the CORE library as you prefer. And for uncommon
extensions this must be done. The general require statement for a core
extension library is:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/&lt;class|module&gt;/&lt;method&gt;'
</pre>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/time/stamp'
</pre>
<p>
Most &#8220;atoms&#8221; contain only one method, but exceptions occur when
methods are closely tied together.
</p>
<p>
You can load per-class or per-module groups of core methods by requiring
the class or module by name. For example&#8220;
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/time'
</pre>
<p>
Will require all the core <a href="../classes/Time.html">Time</a> method
extensions.
</p>
<p>
Note that some methods that were part of CORE in 1.8 and earlier are now
part of MORE libraries. A good example is &#8216;random.rb&#8217;. There
were separated because they had more specialized use cases, where as CORE
extensions are intended as general purpose.
</p>
<h4><a href="../classes/Method.html">Method</a> <a href="../classes/File.html">File</a> Names</h4>
<p>
Operator method redirect files are stored using English names. For instance
`Proc#*` is `proc/op_mul`.
</p>
<p>
For reference, here is the chart.
</p>
<pre>
     +@   =&gt; op_plus
     -@   =&gt; op_minus
     +    =&gt; op_add
     -    =&gt; op_sub
     **   =&gt; op_pow
     *    =&gt; op_mul
     /    =&gt; op_div
     %    =&gt; op_mod
     ~    =&gt; op_tilde
     &lt;=&gt;  =&gt; op_cmp
     &lt;&lt;   =&gt; op_lshift
     &gt;&gt;   =&gt; op_rshift
     &lt;    =&gt; op_lt
     &gt;    =&gt; op_gt
     ===  =&gt; op_case
     ==   =&gt; op_equal
     =~   =&gt; op_apply
     &lt;=   =&gt; op_lt_eq
     &gt;=   =&gt; op_gt_eq
     |    =&gt; op_or
     &amp;    =&gt; op_and
     ^    =&gt; op_xor
     []=  =&gt; op_store
     []   =&gt; op_fetch
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> simply takes the
&#8217;*&#8217; and translates it into a string acceptable to all file
systems. Also, if a method ends in &#8217;=&#8217;, &#8217;?&#8217; or
&#8217;!&#8217; it is simply removed.
</p>
<h3>MORE Library (aka Standard Library)</h3>
<p>
On top of the extensive CORE library, <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> provides extensions for
Ruby&#8217;s standard library, as well as very small collection of
additional modules and classes to supplement it.
</p>
<p>
Use this library like you would any other 3rd party library. The only
difference between Facet&#8217;s Standard library and other libraries is
the lack of any enclosing @Facets::@ namespace. This is becuase the
libraries provided by <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> are
fairly low-level and very general purpose.
</p>
<p>
When using <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> extended versions of
Ruby&#8217;s standard libraries, the libraries have to loaded manually, of
course. However you do not need to load Ruby&#8217;s library first, as the
Facets&#8217; library will do that automatically.
</p>
<p>
For example, normally one load Ruby&#8217;s <a
href="../classes/OpenStruct.html">OpenStruct</a> class via:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'ostruct'
</pre>
<p>
To load &#8216;ostruct.rb&#8217; plus <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> extensions for it simply use:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/ostruct'
</pre>
<p>
For details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please see the
API documentation.
</p>
<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>
This project thrives on contribution!
</p>
<p>
If you have any extension methods, classes or modules that you think have
very general applicability and would like to see them included in this
project, don&#8217;t hesitiate to submit. Also, if you have better versions
of any thing already included or simply have a patch, they are more than
welcome. We want Ruby <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> to be of
the highest quality.
