<h2>2.9.0 / 2010-09-01</h2>
<p>
This release is fairly extensive as it was originally intended to be v3.0.
After further consideration it was decided to reserve v3.0 for the polish
of real world feedback and more progressive changes. The primary focus of
this release has been the completion of migrating <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> into a true extensions library.
With this release almost all add-on classes and mixins have now been
spun-off to other projects. Only the most general purposes add-on classes
and mixins remain.
</p>
<p>
A new TOUR library division has also been added to complement CORE and
MORE. This division houses purely optional extensions. The new division
serves a couple of useful purposes. In particular, it helps separates the
standard library extensions from optional core extension in the RDocs and
thus makes the perfect place to vet new extension ideas.
</p>
<p>
One important change that will effect anyone using <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> along side ActiveSupport is that
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> no longer tries to
conditionally avoid method overlaps with ActiveSupport. This is fine for
the upcoming ActiveSupport 3.0 library which extends core classes directly
instead of using mixins. One need only require &#8216;facets&#8217; in the
Rails config/preinitializer.rb file and ActiveSupport will take precedence
over <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>. For older versions of
ActiveSupport, the best approach is to cherry pick from <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> just the extensions you want, thus
avoiding any conflicts. There are actually only a dozen or so overlaps and
all are intended to compatible, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be sure.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, it is worth mentioning that this release has been more thuroughly
tested than any version of <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> to
date. Thanks to RVM this release runs green on Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.

<h2>2.8.3 / 2010-04-10</h2>
<p>
New release which makes a few adjustments in Kernel core extensions, adds a
few new extensions and additions, plus other small improvements. The
biggest change is the addition of Recusor, which is created via
Enumerable#recursive. This class is somewhat like <a
href="../classes/Enumerator.html">Enumerator</a> and provides a number of
recursive methods.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>9 New Core Extensions

<ul>
<li>Enumerable#recursive provides a number of other recursive methods.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Enumerable.html#M000144">Enumerable#visit</a> can be
used to recursively iterate any <a

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Module.html#M000495">Module#set</a> has been added
(from Sinatra).

</li>
<li>Symbol#/ is added to be like String#/.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Struct.html#M000709">Struct#to_h</a> is added and will

<li><a href="../classes/ObjectSpace.html#M000541">ObjectSpace#reflect</a>
routes method calls to Kernel context.

</li>
<li>Kernel#dup! is same as try_dup from extlib.

variation of extname (Lavir the Whiolet).

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 Core Extensions Renamed

<ul>
<li>Renamed set_from to assign_from (alias remains until Kernel#set is
considerd).

</li>
<li>Renamed populate to assign and improve.

</li>
<li>Kernel#instance_vars is now Kernel#instance and also more useful.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 Core Deprecation

<ul>
<li>Removed instance_eval hack.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 Core Bug Fixes

values.

</li>
<li>prepend.rb allows for AOP-like inclusion of modules.

</li>
<li>roman.rb provides simple roman numeral extensions to <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a> and <a

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 More Improvements

<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/Pathname.html#M001013">Pathname#visit</a> for iterating
all entries beneath a path (chikamichi).

</li>

<h2>2.8.2 / 2010-02-22</h2>
<p>
This release fixes a bug by removing Numeric#size. Turns out that was a
core method already. It includes an &#8220;auditing&#8221; of the core
enumerable method which has led to a few modifications most noteable amoung
them renaming map_detect to find_yield and compact_map to purge.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>7 New Core Extensions

<ul>

<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 New Standard Extension

<ul>
<li>Added <a href="../classes/Pathname.html#M001008">Pathname#glob_relative</a>
to pathanme.rb.

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Loading string/tab.rb no longer loads margin.rb or expand_tab.rb.

</li>
<li>Fixed FileList method delegations.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Numeric.html#M000506">Numeric#length</a> and size

</ul>
<h2>2.8.0 / 2009-11-05</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.8 effectively completes the
MORE library clean-up which peaked with the previous 2.7 release. Another
eight libraries have been deprecated, a few of them spun-off to a separate
project. However, this verison also reverts a few of the deprecations made
in the last version. These libs will remain in Facets&#8217;s MORE library
for the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
This version effectively concludes the MORE library clean-up. The next, and
last version before <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 3.0, will
focus on &#8220;auditing&#8221; the CORE library.
</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.7.0 / 2009-08-01</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.7 is the biggest release of
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> since 2.4. Rather then
trickle-release these changes over the course of the 2.6.x series, I made
the decision to let 2.7 have them all at once. In so doing this release
nearly completes the process of trimming down the MORE library to its
essentials. Over 40 high-level libraries have been spun-off as separate
gems and/or deprecated. No doubt this is a big change for <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>, and the transition may be a bit
bumpy over the short-term, but I am certain that in the long-run everyone
involved will be better served. To help, I have listed the effected
libraries and the alternate gems availble to take their place.
</p>
<p>
A few other changes have also been made in the release that may also effect
your code. In particular you should note that class_extension has been
renamed to class_extend (require &#8216;facets/class_extend&#8217;). In
addition we have added a few new core methods such as <a
href="../classes/Exception.html#M000152">Exception#raised?</a> and <a
href="../classes/Symbol.html#M000667">Symbol#thrown?</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Spun-Off Projects

</li>
</ul>
<p>
These libraries have been deprectated from <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> entirely, but are available as
separate gems (or soon will be).

<ul>
<li>Deprecations Without Current Replacement

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The libraries have been deprecated but do not yet have replacements.
Seperate gems for these are planned though.
</p>
<pre>
    * bbcode.rb
    * ini.rb
    * settings.rb
    * xmlhash.rb
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Deprecations Merged Into CORE

</li>
</ul>
<p>
These libraries have been deprecated because their functionality was merged
into the CORE library and/or made available in some another way.
</p>
<pre>
    * 1stclassmethod.rb   #method! and #instance_method! are now part of CORE.
    * elementor.rb        #per has been added to CORE.
    * elementwise.rb      #ewise has been added to CORE.
    * consoleutils.rb     #ask is in CORE, for the rest see Ansi or Clio project.
    * attr.rb             Added Module#attr_setter to CORE, and separated the rest in MORE.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>General Deprecations

</li>
</ul>
<p>
These libraries have simply been deprecated because they were found lacking
in some significant fashion.
</p>
<pre>
    * nilstatus.rb        Poved rather useless, not to mention trivial.
    * heap.rb             Heap was just an alias for PQueue anyway. Use 'pqueue' instead.
    * dependency.rb       Other solutions exist that are much better (like Advisable).
    * classmethods.rb     #class_extend solution is more robust.
    * ziputils.rb         Have a look at Folio (gem install folio) for replacement.
    * unheritable.rb      Implementation is trivial and usefulness questionable.
    * instantise.rb       Replaced by instance_function.rb.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Other Enhancements

<pre>
  * Fixed Proc#curry to work with #define_method (Thanks to R.Potter)
  * Module#class_extension has been renamed to #class_extend (require 'facets/class_extend').
  * kernel#instance is no longer in core; now it is an extra monkey patch for #instance_eval.
  * Kernel#this has been removed. It is equivalent to 'method(__method__)'.
  * BlankSlate is now an alias for BasicObject, and will be deprecated in the future.
  * Kernel#method! and Module#instance_method! now use a global variable for their cache.
  * #object_state (old name was #state) has been added to core.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.6.0 / 2009-07-03</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.6.0 removes htmlfilter.rb and
cssfilter.rb due to licensing incompatability. These scripts are now
available as a separate package called &#8216;htmlfilter&#8217;. Also
removed are a few MORE libs that were too expiremental and/or not robust
enough. Effectively this finishes up the &#8220;spring cleaning&#8221; of
the MORE lib mentioned a few releases back.
</p>
<p>
But it also marks a new start in trimming MORE down further. We have
decided to do this for three reasons 1) Some of the MORE libs would be
better served as separate projects. 2) <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> will become a tighter library,
primarily focused on extensions. And 3) all libraries involved will become
easier to maintain and thus more robust in the long run.
</p>
<p>
This release also fixes an important arity bug with the recently added
Module#extend method &#8212;one of the very few actual core overrides in <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>7 Major Enhancements

<pre>
  * Removed htmlfilter.rb due to licensing issues.
  * Also removed cssfilter.rb ('gem install htmlfilter' now)
  * Removed rwdelegator.rb, simply not a robust solution.
  * Removed buildable.rb, api is too confusing.
  * Removed meta.rb which was not very useful and too expiremental anyway.
  * Removed prototype.rb, which needs it's own project.
</pre>
</li>
<li>3 Minor Enhancements

<pre>
  * Removed Kernel#__HERE__ as it simply cannot work.
    (Ruby 1.9.2 will offer #source_location for the same, btw)
  * Returned binding/opvars to core.
  * Added Integer#length as suggested by Victor H. Goff III.
</pre>
</li>
<li>1 Bug Fix

<pre>
  * Fixed arity issue with Module#extend.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.5.2 / 2009-04-07</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.5.2 is a simple maintentance
release which fixed a few issues in the new to_hash.rb library. This
release also added <a
href="../classes/String.html#M000646">String#lowercase</a> and
String#uppercae.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Major Enhancement

<pre>
  * added string/uppercase and lowercase
</pre>
</li>
<li>1 Minor Enhancement

<pre>
  * adjustments to to_hash.rb
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.5.1 / 2009-03-05</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.5.1 fixes a few bugs, makes
some small but nice additions and improves 1.9 compatibility.
</p>
<p>
The most important addition to make note of is Object#extend, which has
been overridden to allow a block parameter. This is one of only two or
three actual &#8220;monkey patches&#8221; in all of <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>. The block, when provided, is used
to create an annonymous module which then extends the reciever. This is a
&#8220;good practice&#8221; way to extend objects, rather than using
class_eval on the singleton class.
</p>
<p>
Special thanks to Erik Veenstra, Pit Capitan and especially Sandor Szücs
for their contributions to this release.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>7 Major Enhancements

<pre>
  * added Hash#group_by_value (thanks to Erik Veenstra)
  * added String#file
  * added Hash#new_with (Pit Capitan)
  * added module/extend.rb, now can take a block.
  * added hook.rb
  * added to_h_auto
  * overhauled to_hash.rb, now has multiple methods
</pre>
</li>
<li>10 Bug Fixes

<pre>
  * corrected ostruct.rb to test for frozen state on updates
  * fixed String#left_align
  * fixed conflict between test_name.rb and test_arguments.rb
  * fixed Enumreable#split when reciever is empty array
  * fixed coruption of reciever by Hash#collate (thanks to Tilo Sloboda)
  * fixed Array#to_h, h={} was not initialized
  * fixed test of Module#conflict according ruby19
  * fixed Hash#dearray_singluar_values
  * association.rb stores reference when using #new
  * changed Array#product to make it compatible to ruby 19, deleted block parameter
</pre>
</li>
<li>5 Minor Enhancements

<pre>
  * split enumerable/collect into map_with_index and compact_map
  * improved Array#to_h for 1.9 using flatten(1)
  * Dictionary#replace can take regular Hash too
  * move test_to_hash.rb from more to core
  * Doc'd that UnboundMethod#name returns Symbol in 1.9, but String in 1.8
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.5.0 / 2008-11-23</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.5.0 is an important milestone
in the development of <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>.
</p>
<p>
This release has been tested against Rails&#8217; ActiveSupport library. As
long as <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> is loaded after
ActiveSupport, everything should work fine. Of course, there&#8217;s no
counting for real world trials, but all ActiveSupport testcases pass under
this scenario.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, this release is the first of two (or three) down-scaling releases
intended to remove all the remaining &#8220;excess&#8221; from the library.
This is being done for a variety of reasons. Some scripts are substantial
enough to be one their own and have been spun-off into separate largely
compatible projects. In this release:
</p>
<pre>
  If you were using...   Use this project instead...

    annotations.rb         Anise

    bytes.rb               RichUnits
    times.rb

    command.rb             Clio
    consoleutils.rb
</pre>
<p>
A few others scripts have been deprecated, without an alternative recourse,
simply because they were too weak, such as uploadutils.rb, or highly
experimental, such as chain.rb and eventhook.rb.
</p>
<p>
Although this release constitutes an over all slimming down of <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>, two excellent new libraries have
been added.
</p>
<p>
1) <b>ini.rb</b> by Jeena Paradies. While <a
href="../classes/YAML.html">YAML</a> is frequently used by Rubyists for
configuration files, a full-on serializer like <a
href="../classes/YAML.html">YAML</a> is often overkill. INI files provide a
lightweight solution specifically geared for configuration.
</p>
<p>
2) <b>filter.rb</b> by Brian Candler offers lazy evaluation chains of <a
href="../classes/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a> methods. This is an
elegant way to optimize contiguous maps, selections, etc. &#8212;effective
even on infinite enumerators. (Note, the name of this library may be
changed in the next release.)
</p>
<p>
While work remains to be done, I am happy to say, <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> is finally beginning to approach
the level of solidity I set out to achieve just over a year ago. Thank the
Maker!
</p>
<p>
Special thanks to Brian Candler, Jeena Paradies and Tyler Rick.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>9 Major Changes

<pre>
  * added Brian Candler's Enumerator::Filter
  * added sparse_array.rb (was old harray.rb)
  * added Jeena Paradies' ini.rb
  * renamed CacheDelegator to Memoizer
  * renamed DictionaryMatcher to just Matcher
  * deprecated bytes.rb and times.rb (use RichUnits instead)
  * deprecated uploadutils.rb; ziputils.rb will be (use Folio)
  * deprecated annotations.rb (use Anise instead)
  * deprecated command.rb and consoleutils.rb (use Clio instead)
</pre>
</li>
<li>5 Minor Changes

<pre>
  * deprecated chain.rb (very expiremental)
  * deprecated eventhook.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
  * deprecated tagiter.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
  * moved Hash#symolize_keys and #stringify_keys to core lib
    (still recommend #rekey instead though)
  * switched to git as of 2.4.5
</pre>
</li>
<li>4 Bug Fixes

<pre>
  * memoize.rb, cache was at class-level, now at instance-level
  * binding/caller.rb, fixed require for callstack.rb
  * fixed missing require in string/tabto.rb
  * Fixed some bugs with Time#ago/Time#hence not changing years
    correctly when you changed months.
    (For example, Time.utc(2008, 1, 1).ago(12, :months) incorrectly
    returned 2009-01-01 instead of 2007-01-01.)
    Changed Time#ago/Time#hence to still work if passed negative number.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4.5 / 2008-10-02</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.4.5 is a maintaince release.
This release is notable however in that it will likely be the last that to
use SVN. <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> will be switching to
Git. Also, some libraries that have been flagged &#8220;to be
deprecated&#8221; for some time will finally be so.
</p>
<p>

</pre>
</li>
<li>14 Minor Enhancements

<pre>
  * OpenStruct.new can now take a default block, like Hash.new.
  * Moved variablize methods out of metaid.rb and into separate files (string/ and symbol/).  (#r1042)
  * Added Time#advance.  (#r1046)
  * Speed up of Integer odd/even methods.  (#r1057)

<h2>2.4.4 / 2008-09-01</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.4.4 includes a major bug fix
that caused <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> not to load
properly, having to do with a <a href="../classes/Time.html">Time</a>
extension. The problem has been fixed. In addition, this release put <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> only a few pending adjustments
away from full Rails/ActiveSupport compatibility.

<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>10 Major Enhancements

  * Added Symbol#plain?, Symbol#query? and Symbol#setter?  (#1011)
  * Removed Time#to_date.
    * Due to clobberd RI Docs (!) this should have been in Lore lib date.rb

<h2>2.4.3 / 2008-08-14</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> is almost fully interoperable
with ActiveSupport and Ruby 1.9. We will continue to improve this
interoperability in upcoming releases.
</p>
<p>
As a REMINDER, <a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.4+ now
encourages:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantages to do this for the sake of improved
interoperability. The practice of cherry-picking can become problematic if
other dependent libraries have cherry-picked different methods. In those
cases these distinctions go unaccounted and untested.
</p>
<p>
Note that this release does not include a setup.rb script. We are working
on a new version of this script, which we plan to include in the next
release.
</p>
<p>
This release give special thanks to the following people for their
contributions: Ken Bloom, Nick Caruso, Evgeniy Dolzhenko, Andy Freeman,
Tomasz Muras and Dave Myron. And of course, to anyone else I failed to
mention that has contributed.
</p>
<p>
(NOTE: 2.4.3&#8217;s changes may actually be long to 2.4.2. Notice the
releases are only two days apart. There was an issue with 2.4.2 and it had
to be replaced immediately. So take the distinct with a grain of salt.)
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Additions

<pre>
  * Add Time#trunc and Time#round to Core.
  * Add Array#recursively and fixed bug in Hash#recursively.
  * Add Kernel#instance method which provides a fluent interface to private object space.
  * Add Symbol#plain?, Symbol#query? and Symbol#setter?
  * Add Hash#symbolize_keys and #stringify_keys.
  * Add File#split_root.
  * Add #glob and #glob_first as extensions to Pathname.
  * Add NilClass#ergo whic points back to kernel/ergo.
  * Add #bump method to VersionNumber class.
  * Add String#mask providing powerful string manipulation.
  * Add Ken Bloom's DictionaryMatcher class (will be renamed in future version)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Deprecations

<pre>
  * Deprecate Hash#keys_to_s and Hash#keys_to_sym.
    * These are the original versions of these methods.
    * But now we can use #rekey(:to_s) and #rekey(:to_sym) instead.
  * Deprecat ruby.rb, which was a sort 1.9 compatibility layer.
</pre>
</li>
<li>22 Major Enhancements

<pre>
  * Changed File#rewrite to not use the in-place change of the string.
  * Renamed Class#to_pathname and #to_methodname to #pathize and #methodize.
  * Removed Console:: namespace for ANSICode.
  * Moved Mentalguy's lazy.rb to core!
  * Added Indexable and Stackable to core.
  * BasicObject is now just a synonm for BlankSlate unless Ruby 1.9.  [major]

</pre>
</li>
<li>19 Minor Enhancements

<pre>
  * Improved File#rootname --it is now more robust.
  * Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again.
  * Created Lore library to house extensions to Ruby's standard library.
  * Re-added facets class files (eg. facets/string) and are now dynamic.
  * Added block to Array#index.
    * This is one of the few core overrides in Facets.
    * It is a feature already in Ruby 1.9.
  * Added Jim Weirich's BlankSlate class.
    * This is a temporary measure be compatible w/ AcitveSupport's BasicObject.
  * Split kernel/load.rb into require_all.rb and require_local.rb.
  * Split module/alias.rb up into alias_accessor, alias_module_function and alias_method_chain.
  * Renamed string/subtract to string/op_sub.
    Old name will remain for time being for compatability. [minor]
  * Moved style.rb to string/stylize.rb  [minor]
  * Added warning to bytes to use RichUnits instead.
  * Updated warn line fore eventual deprecation of fileshell and arguments.*
  * Added facets-load.rb to allow old school cherry picking.*
    * Between 2.0 and 2.4 require 'facets' simply added core to LOAD_PATH.
    * Starting with 2.4 it loads all of core automatically instead.
    * facets-load.rb provides a way to use the old behavior.
          require 'facets-load.rb
          require 'kernel/with'
          require 'symbol/to_proc'
    * This adds the path to the end of LOAD_PATH to prevent any load conflicts.

  * While not perceptible to an end user, there are now 3 divisions: lib/core, lib/lore, lib/more.
  * Modified script/test to display $LOAD_PATH before running tests.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4.2 / 2008-08-12</h2>
<p>
Just some more of those great old work your ass off changes.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Major Enhancements

<pre>
  * Added Ken Bloom's DictionaryMatcher class from Ruby Quiz #103.
    (Note this class will probably be renamed in the future.)
  * Changed File#rewrite to not use the inplace change of the string.
    * If you were using the function, change your code to use File#rewrite! instead.
    * Or, modify your code ot use the new behavior.
    * This change can make for a slippery bug, so be sure to check for it!
  * Moved live.rb to facets-live.rb.
  * Added kernel/instance method which provides a fluent interface to private object space.
</pre>
</li>
<li>5 Minor Enhancements

<pre>
  * Added sow generation forms.
  * Spilt Time#trunc into separate file.
  * Remove old log files --shouldn't version control these.
  * Added note to FileList to add glob options parameter.
  * Added optional argument to Dictionary#first and #last.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Other Enhancements

<pre>
  * Move &quot;lore&quot; tests to test/lore (lore are extensions to Ruby's standard lib).
  * Added test/core, test/lore and test/more.
  * Added time/test_round.rb
  * Added array/recursively.
  * Added time/round.
  * Time#to_date makes the public (it already existed in Ruby!)
  * Fixed Time#hence to flip year correctly when adding months.
  * Work on documentation using new Sow system.
  * Moved meta.rb to more/kernel/meta.rb and merged facets/core.rb into facets.rb.
  * Added more/kernel directory --hey not every extension can be core.
  * Adjusted loadpath and moved lazy.rb to core!
  * Moved remaing files to subdirectory locations.
  * Moved most core libs to core/.
  * Move most more files to the more directory.
  * Added lore and more directories.
  * Added facets/core directory. Yes, I'm spiliting the lib again.
    * Loadpath will be used, so user inteface will stay the same.
    * Setup.rb will be adjusted to recognaize loadpath.
  * Removed Rope class. If anything this will have a separate project.
  * Moved setup.rb to script/setup.
    * This will either be replaced with configure/install scripts.
    * Or, depend on a separate ruby setup.rb project.
  * Added recorder.rb to consider in work directory.
  * Added admin directory.
  * Added &quot;TO BE DEPRECATED&quot; message to ruby.rb.
  * Added all methods from ruby.rb as individual core methods.
    * These are the methods that overlap with 1.9.
    * They are encased in 'unless RUBY_VERSION' caluses.
  * Imporved file/rootname --now much more robust.
  * Added Kernel#to_yamlfrag to yaml.rb as way to output yaml w/o the &quot;---&quot; header.
    * Perhaps not the most robust solution, but okay for now.
    * Maybe a poor name for the method, but you got a better one?
  * Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again like it used to be. Because:
    (1) that seems to be the way most other FileUtils methods are (cd, mkdir, cp, ...) and the most
        obvious way that users would WANT to use FileUtils: FileUtils.whereis(&quot;ruby&quot;).
    (2) I see module_function used in other comparible parts of Facets: UploadUtils, ConsoleUtils,
        ZipUtils, FileUtils#safe_ln, ...
    (3) My code that relied on the old module_function behavior was breaking
        What were you thinking changing it?? ;)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4.1 / 2008-04-03</h2>
<p>
This release takes aim at improving compatability with ActiveSupport. It
also reintroduces an improved paramix.rb.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Major Enhancements

<pre>
  * A much improved paramix.rb has been returned to the library.
    * There a no longer capitialize module methods at all.
    * Use Module#[] and mixin_params[] instead.
  * Deprecated behavior.rb. It was not robust.
  * Added basex.rb, for working in any encoding base using any character set (base62 is the default).
</pre>
</li>
<li>3 Minor Enhancements

<pre>
  * Comparing to ActiveSupport, found 63 extension clashes, but most are due to 1.9 features.
    The rest should be compatible.
  * Reatomized a number of Kernel and String methods. Reatomization is nearly complete.
  * Continued work on reatomizing core extensions (nearly complete now).
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4.0 / 2008-03-24</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> 2.4 is a major step forward for
<a href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a>. It is perhaps the release that
2.0 should have been, but of course it took the actual 2.0 release to make
2.4 possible. Some annoyances you may have encountered in updating your
code to 2.0 are now fixed. And from 2.4 on, <a
href="../classes/Facets.html">Facets</a> will now be settling down into
simple refinement release cycles for a while.
</p>
<p>
The main change under the hood is to bring everything up to the top
lib/facets/ directory. No longer are the libraries sorted by category. I
had done so for a long time to make it easier to track the various libs,
but in the end it was only making it more diffcult to deal with build tools
and packaging.
</p>
<p>
For the end-user, the largest change is a new emphisis on:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter- intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantantages to do this for the sake of
interoperability than the practice of cherry-picking. The reason is simply
because others may have cherry-picked different methods, and those
distinctions go unaccounted and untested.
</p>
<p>
Also with this release, to bolster the use of require &#8216;facets&#8217;,
some lack-luster extensions have been deprecated and namespace usage has
been improved. In addition, we are getting very close to full
ActiveSupport, and Ruby 1.9, interoperability. Expect this to be complete
in the next minor release or two.
</p>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancements

<pre>
  * String#to_re and String#to_rx have swapped default behaviors. #to_rx escapes, #to_re does not.
  * The Console namespace is being deprecated. command.rb and arguments.rb now use CLI naemspace.
  * #compare_on and #equate_on are now &quot;mixin methods&quot; Comparable() and Equateable().
  * Enumerable#product, #combintations and #permutations have change to be Ruby 1.9 compatible.
  * thread.rb, map_send, et al, block is passed to send instead of yielding on result.
  * namespace.rb has been renamed to methodspace.rb.
  * Ruby 1.9 defined a new Proc#curry method, so Facets version has been made compatible.
  * The old curry method is now called #partial, as in &quot;partial application&quot;.
  * Deprecated interface.rb. Perhaps a better approach but nonetheless extraneous.
  * Deprecated paramix.rb. A better way is to use a capitialized methods. (Perhaps a lib for that?)
  * Brought back a few web related libs, htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb in particular.
  * camelcase and snakecase are core extensions. For specialized styles use String#style in style.rb.
  * Renamed ArgVector to CLI::Arguments
  * Moved one_nine.rb to ruby.rb
  * Moved test/test_one_nine.rb to test/test_ruby.rb.
  * Updated requires for &quot;one_nine&quot; to just &quot;ruby&quot; b/c of backports to 1.8.7.
  * Added warning to Rick Kilmers's unit system.
      * Moving Rich Kilmers's units system to it's own package.
      * Three are alternate unit systems available and Facets should work with any of them.
      * Will keep a fair amount of the Time extensions though.
  * Moved nil/status.rb to nilstatus.rb
  * Got rid of Method#curry and Method#partial since they just convert to Procs.
  * Made op_esc.rb a separate module rather thanan extension.
  * Deprecated with_reader, with_writer and with_accessor for attr_singleton_reader, &amp;c.
  * Deprecated Hash#pairs_at. Use Hash#slice instead from core.
  * Fixed the namespaces of some extensions.
  * Added prime directory and files.
  * Removed all &quot;prime&quot; extension files.
  * Move mattr to module.
  * Fixed require bug in time methods.
  * Reverted memomize.rb back to original code --will come back to later.

  * Added case/stylize methods to more/facets/string.
  * Renamed more/string/facets/titlecase to captialize_all.
  * Added uri and xoxo tests.
  * Progressive work on memoize and elementor.

  * Update to command.rb integrating MasterCommand and Command into a single class.
  * Added options back into multiglob_r.
  * Improved cloneable.rb to be a true deep dup/clone mixin using Ken Bloom's suggestion.
  * Added tasksystem.rb.
  * Added enumerable/combinations.
  * Added openhash and tracepoint.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes

<pre>
  * Fixed bug with #peek in stackable.
  * Fixed bug in Kernel#object_hexid.
  * Fixed bug in multiglob_r so it will NOT follow symlinks.
  * Fixed test_keyize.rb.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Adminstrative Changes

<pre>
  * This was a fairly large and fast-paced update, so unfortunately not all changes are listed this time.
  * Added ri generation to setup.rb.
  * Updated README and allowed doc/ to be included in package.
  * Finally completed removal of all embedded tests.
  * Organized all libs between core, more, class and mixin.

  * enumerable/each_slice.rb [replace]
    Ruby already has #each_slice if you require 'enumerator'. And for 1.9,
    I believe, this will be present automatically. So Facets' each_slice
    has been replaced with a simple redirection to require 'enumerator'.
    Ruby's version is slightly different in that it won't check arity if
    a slice count is not given. For this, use enumerable/each_by.
  * array/delete_at.rb [removed]
    Ruby's Array class already has a #delete_at method,
    although this is another method at odds with Hash.
    Use #delete_values_at instead.

<h2>1.4.5 / 2006-07-05</h2>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Additions

<pre>
  * Add NilClass#status which allows a message to be passed through a failure chain.
  * Add Module#alias_method_chain from Rails as a cleveridiom for module-based method wrapping.

<pre>
  * Removed hash/keys_to_iv b/c it is a poor name. Since the alternative
    of #keys_to_instance_variables conveys the wrong idea, decided to just
    get rid of this. Instead use the hash#variablize_keys which is also
    Rails compatibile.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.3 / 2006-06-27</h2>

<h2>1.4.2 / 2006-06-21</h2>
<p>
This release makes adjustments to <a
href="../classes/BasicObject.html">BasicObject</a>, further reducing
unhidden methods. Among them <em>object</em>, <em>method</em> and as. Also
added `method_missing` that detects shadow methods and rebinds them to
Object. Keep in mind that woun&#8217;t help you if you override
method_missing which is typical for this class.
</p>
<p>
This release also marks the first use of Darcs version control manager!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements

<h2>1.4.0 / 2006-05-05</h2>
<p>
Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Additions

  * Added Cookie, HTTP and HTTPAccess of ...'s library.
  * Added OpenCascade, which is like OpenObject but chains access.
  * Added MenTalguy's lazy.rb which include's Future and Promise classes.
  * Added task.rb, which provides a Rake interface compatible task
    system, but that can be used in any code.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Improvements

<pre>
  * Improved Hash#traverse (it now does all traversing before yielding).
  * Console::Command also now supports run-on flags (eg. -xvzf).
  * Updated tuple.rb so that when a string is converted to a Tuple (#to_t)
    the values wll be made integers if they are composed of only numbers.
    If you need all strings you can use a block since the block bypasses
    this auto coercement, eg. to_t{ |v| v }.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Renames

<pre>
  * OpenObject's __get__ and __set__ methods have been changed
    to __fetch__ and __store__ to correspond to the Hash methods.

  * Console::Application is deprecated and is no longer an alias for
    Console::Command.
  * More's classinherit.rb has been removed, and classmethods.rb will be
    too in  another version or two. You should transition all uses of
    these to core/module/class_extension.rb.
