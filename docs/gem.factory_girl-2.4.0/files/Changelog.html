2.4.0 (January 13, 2012)
</p>
<pre>
  Refactor internals of Factory Girl to use anonymous class on which attributes
    get defined
  Explicitly require Ruby 1.8.7 or higher in gemspec
  Fix documentation
  Add Gemnasium status to documentation
  Supplying a Class to a factory that overrides to_s no longer results in
    getting the wrong Class constructed
  Be more agnostic about ORMs when using columns in Factory Girl step
    definitions
  Test against Active Record 3.2.0.rc2
  Update GETTING_STARTED to use Ruby syntax highlighting
</pre>
<p>
2.3.2 (November 26, 2011)
</p>
<pre>
  Move logic of where instance.save! is set to Definition
  Fix method name from aliases_for? to alias_for?
  Refactor internal attribute handling to use an anonymous class instead of
    faking Ruby's variable resolution. This allows for more sane usage of
    attributes without having to manage sorting priority because attributes
    can turn themselves into procs, which are used with define_method on a
    class so attributes work correctly all the time.
</pre>
<p>
2.3.1 (November 23, 2011)
</p>
<pre>
  Remove internally-used associate method from all the FactoryGirl::Proxy subclasses
  Move around requiring of files
  Consolidate errors into factory_girl.rb
  Refactor AttributeList to deal with priority only when iterating over
    attributes
  Refactor internals of some of the Proxy subclasses
  Ensure callbacks on traits are executed in the correct order
</pre>
<p>
2.3.0 (November 18, 2011)
</p>
<pre>
  Registries are named, resulting in better messages when factories, traits,
    or sequences cannot be found
  Fix incorrect tests
  Internals refactoring introducing FactoryGirl::NullFactory,
    FactoryGirl::Definition, and FactoryGirl::DeclarationList
  Use ActiveSupport for Hash#except and its delegation capabilities
  Fix usage of callbacks when added via implicit traits
  Use Bundler tasks and clean up dependencies
  Fix failing spec for big letters in factory name passed as symbol
  Add ability for traits to be added dynamically when creating an instance via
    build, create, build_stubbed, or attributes_for
</pre>
<p>
2.2.0 (October 14, 2011)
</p>
<pre>
  Clean up RSpec suite to not use 'should'
  Use create_list in step definitions
  Syntax methods that deal with ORM interaction (attributes_for, build, build_stubbed,
    and create) now accept a block that yields the result. This results in a
    more convenient way to interact with the result than using Object.tap.
  Standardize deprecation warnings
  Update transient attribute syntax to use blocks instead of calling ignore on
    each attribute declaration
  Parents can be defined after children because factories are evaluated when
    they're used; this means breaking up factories across multiple files will
    behave as expected
  Large internal refactoring, including changing access modifiers for a
    handful of methods for a more clearly defined API
</pre>
<p>
2.1.2 (September 23, 2011)
</p>
<pre>
  Bugfix: Vintage syntax fixed after bug introduced in 2.1.1
  Introduce dependency on activesupport to remove code from Factory class
</pre>
<p>
2.1.1 (September 23, 2011) (yanked)
</p>
<pre>
  Bugfix: Parent object callbacks are run before child object callbacks
  Declarations: allow overriding/modification of individual traits in child factories
  Callbacks refactored to not be attributes
  Updating documentation for formatting and clarity (incl. new specificity for cucumber)
</pre>
<p>
2.1.0 (September 02, 2011)
</p>
<pre>
  Bugfix: created_at now defined for stubbed models
  Gemspec updated for use with Rails 3.1
  Factories can now be modified post-definition (useful for overriding defaults from gems/plugins)
  All factories can now be reloaded with Factory.reload
  Add :method =&gt; build to factory associations to prevent saving of associated objects
  Factories defined in {Rails.root}/factories are now loaded by default
  Various documentation updates
</pre>
<p>
1.1.4 (November 28, 2008)
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.build now uses Factory.create for associations of the built object
  Factory definitions are now detected in subdirectories, such as
                factories/person_factory.rb (thanks to Josh Nichols)
  Factory definitions are now loaded after the environment in a Rails project
                (fixes some issues with dependencies being loaded too early) (thanks to
                Josh Nichols)
  Factory names ending in 's' no longer cause problems (thanks to Alex Sharp
                and Josh Owens)
</pre>
<p>
1.1.3 (September 12, 2008)
</p>
<pre>
  Automatically pull in definitions from factories.rb, test/factories.rb, or
        spec/factories.rb
</pre>
<p>
1.1.2 (July 30, 2008)
</p>
<pre>
  Improved error handling for invalid and undefined factories/attributes
        Improved handling of strings vs symbols vs classes
        Added a prettier syntax for handling associations
  Updated documentation and fixed compatibility with Rails 2.1

1.1.1 (June 23, 2008)
</p>
<pre>
  The attribute &quot;name&quot; no longer requires using #add_attribute
</pre>
<p>
1.1.0 (June 03, 2008)
</p>
<pre>
        Added support for dependent attributes
        Fixed the attributes_for build strategy to not build associations
  Added support for sequences
</pre>
<p>
