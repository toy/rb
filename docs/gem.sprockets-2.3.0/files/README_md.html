# Sprockets: Rack-based asset packaging
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> is a Ruby library for
compiling and serving web assets. It features declarative dependency
management for JavaScript and CSS assets, as well as a powerful
preprocessor pipeline that allows you to write assets in languages like
CoffeeScript, Sass, SCSS and LESS.
</p>
<p>
# Installation #
</p>
<p>
Install <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> from RubyGems:
</p>
<pre>
    $ gem install sprockets
</pre>
<p>
Or include it in your project&#8217;s `Gemfile` with Bundler:
</p>
<pre>
    gem 'sprockets', '~&gt; 2.0'
</pre>
<p>
# Understanding the <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>
Environment #
</p>
<p>
You&#8217;ll need an instance of the `Sprockets::Environment` class to
access and serve assets from your application. Under Rails 3.1 and later,
`YourApp::Application.assets` is a preconfigured `Sprockets::Environment`
instance. For Rack-based applications, create an instance in `config.ru`.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> `Environment` has
methods for retrieving and serving assets, manipulating the load path, and
registering processors. It is also a Rack application that can be mounted
at a URL to serve assets over HTTP.
</p>
<p>
## The Load Path ##
</p>
<p>
The *load path* is an ordered list of directories that <a
href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> uses to search for assets.
</p>
<p>
In the simplest case, a <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>
environment&#8217;s load path will consist of a single directory containing
your application&#8217;s asset source files. When mounted, the environment
will serve assets from this directory as if they were static files in your
public root.
</p>
<p>
The power of the load path is that it lets you organize your source files
into multiple directories &#8212; even directories that live outside your
application &#8212; and combine those directories into a single virtual
filesystem. That means you can easily bundle JavaScript, CSS and images
into a Ruby library and import them into your application.
</p>
<p>
### Manipulating the Load Path ###
</p>
<p>
To add a directory to your environment&#8217;s load path, use the
`append_path` and `prepend_path` methods. Directories at the beginning of
the load path have precedence over subsequent directories.
</p>
<pre>
    environment = Sprockets::Environment.new
    environment.append_path 'app/assets/javascripts'
    environment.append_path 'lib/assets/javascripts'
    environment.append_path 'vendor/assets/jquery'
</pre>
<p>
In general, you should append to the path by default and reserve prepending
for cases where you need to override existing assets.
</p>
<p>
## Accessing Assets ##
</p>
<p>
Once you&#8217;ve set up your environment&#8217;s load path, you can mount
the environment as a Rack server and request assets via HTTP. You can also
access assets programmatically from within your application.
</p>
<p>
### Logical Paths ###
</p>
<p>
Assets in <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> are always
referenced by their *logical path*.
</p>
<p>
The logical path is the path of the asset source file relative to its
containing directory in the load path. For example, if your load path
contains the directory `app/assets/javascripts`:
</p>
<p>
<table>
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Asset source file&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Logical path&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;app/assets/javascripts/application.js&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;application.js&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;app/assets/javascripts/models/project.js&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;models/project.js&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
</pre>
<p>
</table>
</p>
<p>
In this way, all directories in the load path are merged to create a
virtual filesystem whose entries are logical paths.
</p>
<p>
### Serving Assets Over HTTP ###
</p>
<p>
When you mount an environment, all of its assets are accessible as logical
paths underneath the *mount point*. For example, if you mount your
environment at `/assets` and request the URL `/assets/application.js`, <a
href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> will search your load path
for the file named `application.js` and serve it.
</p>
<p>
Under Rails 3.1 and later, your <a
href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> environment is automatically
mounted at `/assets`. If you are using <a
href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> with a Rack application, you
will need to mount the environment yourself. A good way to do this is with
the `map` method in `config.ru`:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'sprockets'
    map '/assets' do
      environment = Sprockets::Environment.new
      environment.append_path 'app/assets/javascripts'
      environment.append_path 'app/assets/stylesheets'
      run environment
    end

    map '/' do
      run YourRackApp
    end
</pre>
<p>
### Accessing Assets Programmatically ###
</p>
<p>
You can use the `find_asset` method (aliased as `[]`) to retrieve an asset
from a <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> environment. Pass
it a logical path and you&#8217;ll get a `Sprockets::BundledAsset` instance
back:
</p>
<pre>
    environment['application.js']
    # =&gt; #&lt;Sprockets::BundledAsset ...&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Call `to_s` on the resulting asset to access its contents, `length` to get
its length in bytes, `mtime` to query its last-modified time, and
`pathname` to get its full path on the filesystem.
</p>
<p>
# Using Engines #
</p>
<p>
Asset source files can be written in another language, like SCSS or
CoffeeScript, and automatically compiled to CSS or JavaScript by <a
href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>. Compilers for these
languages are called <b>engines</b>.
</p>
<p>
Engines are specified by additional extensions on the asset source
filename. For example, a CSS file written in SCSS might have the name
`layout.css.scss`, while a JavaScript file written in CoffeeScript might
have the name `dialog.js.coffee`.
</p>
<p>
## Styling with Sass and SCSS ##
</p>
<p>
[Sass](<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass-lang.com/</a>) is a language
that compiles to CSS and adds features like nested rules, variables, mixins
and selector inheritance.
</p>
<p>
If the `sass` gem is available to your application, you can use Sass to
write CSS assets in <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> supports both Sass
syntaxes. For the original whitespace-sensitive syntax, use the extension
`.css.sass`. For the new SCSS syntax, use the extension `.css.scss`.
</p>
<p>
## Styling with LESS ##
</p>
<p>
[LESS](<a href="http://lesscss.org/">lesscss.org/</a>) extends CSS with
dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.
</p>
<p>
If the `less` gem is available to your application, you can use LESS to
write CSS assets in <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>. Note
that the LESS compiler is written in JavaScript, and at the time of this
writing, the `less` gem depends on `therubyracer` which embeds the V8
JavaScript runtime in Ruby.
</p>
<p>
To write CSS assets with LESS, use the extension `.css.less`.
</p>
<p>
## Scripting with CoffeeScript ##
</p>
<p>
[CoffeeScript](<a
href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script">jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script</a>/)
is a language that compiles to the &#8220;good parts&#8221; of JavaScript,
featuring a cleaner syntax with array comprehensions, classes, and function
binding.
</p>
<p>
If the `coffee-script` gem is available to your application, you can use
CoffeeScript to write JavaScript assets in <a
href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>. Note that the CoffeeScript
compiler is written in JavaScript, and you will need an [ExecJS](<a
href="https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs)-supported">github.com/sstephenson/execjs)-supported</a>
runtime on your system to invoke it.
</p>
<p>
To write JavaScript assets with CoffeeScript, use the extension
`.js.coffee`.
</p>
<p>
## JavaScript Templating with EJS and Eco ##
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> supports *JavaScript
templates* for client-side rendering of strings or markup. JavaScript
templates have the special format extension `.jst` and are compiled to
JavaScript functions.
</p>
<p>
When loaded, a JavaScript template function can be accessed by its logical
path as a property on the global `JST` object. Invoke a template function
to render the template as a string. The resulting string can then be
inserted into the DOM.
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;!-- templates/hello.jst.ejs --&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Hello, &lt;span&gt;&lt;%= name %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;

    // application.js
    //= require templates/hello
    $(&quot;#hello&quot;).html(JST[&quot;templates/hello&quot;]({ name: &quot;Sam&quot; }));
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> supports two JavaScript
template languages: [EJS](<a
href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-ejs">github.com/sstephenson/ruby-ejs</a>),
for embedded JavaScript, and [Eco](<a
href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-eco">github.com/sstephenson/ruby-eco</a>),
for embedded CoffeeScript. Both languages use the familiar `<% … %>`
syntax for embedding logic in templates.
</p>
<p>
If the `ejs` gem is available to your application, you can use EJS
templates in <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>. EJS
templates have the extension `.jst.ejs`.
</p>
<p>
If the `eco` gem is available to your application, you can use [Eco
templates](<a
href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">github.com/sstephenson/eco</a>)
in <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a>. Eco templates have
the extension `.jst.eco`. Note that the `eco` gem depends on the
CoffeeScript compiler, so the same caveats apply as outlined above for the
CoffeeScript engine.
</p>
<p>
## Invoking Ruby with ERB ##
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> provides an ERB engine
for preprocessing assets using embedded Ruby code. Append `.erb` to a CSS
or JavaScript asset&#8217;s filename to enable the ERB engine.
</p>
<p>
*<b>Note</b>*: <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> processes
multiple engine extensions in order from
</p>
<pre>
  right to left, so you can use multiple engines with a single
  asset. For example, to have a CoffeeScript asset that is first
  preprocessed with ERB, use the extension `.js.coffee.erb`.
</pre>
<p>
Ruby code embedded in an asset is evaluated in the context of a
`Sprockets::Context` instance for the given asset. Common uses for ERB
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>embedding another asset as a Base64-encoded `data:` URI with the
`asset_data_uri` helper

</li>
<li>inserting the URL to another asset, such as with the `asset_path` helper
provided by the <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> Rails
plugin

</li>
<li>embedding other application resources, such as a localized string database,
in a JavaScript asset via JSON

</li>
<li>embedding version constants loaded from another file

</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the [Helper Methods](FIXME) section for more information about
interacting with `Sprockets::Context` instances via ERB.
</p>
<p>
### String Interpolation Syntax ###
</p>
<p>
If you need access to Ruby from an asset but cannot use ERB&#8217;s `<% …
%>` syntax, <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> also supports
Ruby string interpolation syntax (`#{ … }`) with the `.str` engine
extension.
</p>
<p>
# Managing and Bundling Dependencies #
</p>
<p>
You can create *asset bundles* &#8212; ordered concatenations of asset
source files &#8212; by specifying dependencies in a special comment syntax
at the top of each source file.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> reads these comments,
called <b>directives</b>, and processes them to recursively build a
dependency graph. When you request an asset with dependencies, the
dependencies will be included in order at the top of the file.
</p>
<p>
## The Directive Processor ##
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> runs the *directive
processor* on each CSS and JavaScript source file. The directive processor
scans for comment lines beginning with `=` in comment blocks at the top of
the file.
</p>
<pre>
    //= require jquery
    //= require jquery-ui
    //= require backbone
    //= require_tree .
</pre>
<p>
The first word immediately following `=` specifies the directive name. Any
words following the directive name are treated as arguments. Arguments may
be placed in single or double quotes if they contain spaces, similar to
commands in the Unix shell.
</p>
<p>
*<b>Note</b>*: Non-directive comment lines will be preserved in the final
</p>
<pre>
  asset, but directive comments are stripped after
  processing. Sprockets will not look for directives in comment blocks
  that occur after the first line of code.
</pre>
<p>
### Supported Comment Types ###
</p>
<p>
The directive processor understands comment blocks in three formats:
</p>
<pre>
    /* Multi-line comment blocks (CSS, SCSS, JavaScript)
     *= require foo
     */

    // Single-line comment blocks (SCSS, JavaScript)
    //= require foo

    # Single-line comment blocks (CoffeeScript)
    #= require foo
</pre>
<p>
## <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> Directives ##
</p>
<p>
You can use the following directives to declare dependencies in asset
source files.
</p>
<p>
For directives that take a <b>path</b> argument, you may specify either a
logical path or a relative path. Relative paths begin with `./` and
reference files relative to the location of the current file.
</p>
<p>
### The `require` Directive ###
</p>
<p>
`require` <b>path</b> inserts the contents of the asset source file
specified by <b>path</b>. If the file is required multiple times, it will
appear in the bundle only once.
</p>
<p>
### The `include` Directive ###
</p>
<p>
`include` <b>path</b> works like `require`, but inserts the contents of the
specified source file even if it has already been included or required.
</p>
<p>
### The `require_directory` Directive ###
</p>
<p>
`require_directory` <b>path</b> requires all source files of the same
format in the directory specified by <b>path</b>. Files are required in
alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>
### The `require_tree` Directive ###
</p>
<p>
`require_tree` <b>path</b> works like `require_directory`, but operates
recursively to require all files in all subdirectories of the directory
specified by <b>path</b>.
</p>
<p>
### The `require_self` Directive ###
</p>
<p>
`require_self` tells <a href="../classes/Sprockets.html">Sprockets</a> to
insert the body of the current source file before any subsequent `require`
or `include` directives.
</p>
<p>
### The `depend_on` Directive ###
</p>
<p>
`depend_on` <b>path</b> declares a dependency on the given <b>path</b>
without including it in the bundle. This is useful when you need to expire
an asset&#8217;s cache in response to a change in another file.
