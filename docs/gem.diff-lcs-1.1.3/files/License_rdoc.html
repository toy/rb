<p>
This software is available under three licenses: the GNU GPL version 2 (or
at your option, a later version), the Perl Artistic license, or the MIT
license. Note that my preference for licensing is the MIT license, but
Algorithm::Diff was dually originally licensed with the Perl Artistic and
the GNU GPL (&#8220;the same terms as Perl itself&#8221;) and that the Ruby
implementation hews pretty closely to the Perl version, so I must maintain
the additional licensing terms.
