        <h2>1.1.3 / 2011-08-27</h2>
<ul>
<li>Converted to &#8216;hoe&#8217; for release.

</li>
<li>Converted tests to RSpec 2.

</li>
<li>Extracted the body of htmldiff into a class available from
diff/lcs/htmldiff.

</li>
<li>Migrated development and issue tracking to GitHub.

</li>
<li>Bugs fixed:

<ul>
<li>Eliminated the explicit use of RubyGems in both bin/htmldiff and bin/ldiff.
Resolves issue 4 (<a
href="https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/4">github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/4</a>).

</li>
<li>Eliminated Ruby warnings. Resolves issue 3 (<a
href="https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/3">github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/3</a>).

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.1.2 / 2004-10-20</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem reported by Mauricio Fernandez in htmldiff.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.1.1 / 2004-09-25</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug 891: <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=407&aid=891&group_id=84">rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=407&aid=891&group_id=84</a>

</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with callback initialisation code (it assumed that all
callbacks passed as classes can be initialised; now, it rescues
NoMethodError in the event of private :new being called).

</li>
<li>Modified the non-initialisable callbacks to have a private new method.

</li>
<li>Moved ldiff core code to <a
href="../classes/Diff/LCS/Ldiff.html">Diff::LCS::Ldiff</a>
(diff/lcs/ldiff.rb).

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.1.0 / -</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eliminated the need for Diff::LCS::Event and removed it.

</li>
<li>Added a contextual diff callback, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallback.

</li>
<li>Implemented patching/unpatching for standard <a
href="../classes/Diff.html">Diff</a> callback output formats with both diff
and sdiff.

</li>
<li>Extensive documentation changes.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.4 / -</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem with bin/ldiff output, especially for unified format.
Newlines that should have been present weren&#8217;t.

</li>
<li>Changed the .tar.gz installer to generate Windows batch files if ones do
not exist already. Removed the existing batch files as they didn&#8217;t
work.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.3 / -</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem with traverse_sequences where the first difference from the
left sequence might not be appropriately captured.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.2 / -</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with ldiff not working because actions were changed from
symbols to strings.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.1 / -</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minor modifications to the gemspec, the README.

</li>
<li>Renamed the diff program to ldiff (as well as the companion batch file) so
as to not collide with the standard diff program.

</li>
<li>Fixed issues with RubyGems. Requires RubyGems > 0.6.1 or >= 0.6.1 with the
latest CVS version.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0 / -</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial release based mostly on Perl&#8217;s Algorithm::Diff.

</li>
</ul>
