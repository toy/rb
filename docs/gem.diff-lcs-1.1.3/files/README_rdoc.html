<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Diff/LCS.html">Diff::LCS</a> is a port of Perl&#8217;s
Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS)
algorithm to compute intelligent differences between two sequenced
enumerable containers. The implementation is based on Mario I.
Wolczko&#8217;s <a
href="ftp://st.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/Smalltalk/MANCHESTER/manchester/4.0/diff.st">Smalltalk
version 1.2</a> (1993) and Ned Konz&#8217;s Perl version <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15/">Algorithm::Diff
1.15</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is release 1.1.3, fixing several small bugs found over the years.
Version 1.1.0 added new features, including the ability to patch and
unpatch changes as well as a new contextual diff callback, <a
href="../classes/Diff/LCS/ContextDiffCallbacks.html">Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallbacks</a>,
that should improve the context sensitivity of patching.
</p>
<p>
This library is called <a href="../classes/Diff/LCS.html">Diff::LCS</a>
because of an early version of Algorithm::Diff which was restrictively
licensed. This version has seen a minor license change: instead of being
under Ruby&#8217;s license as an option, the third optional license is the
MIT license.

</ul>
<p>
This is the new home of <a href="../classes/Diff/LCS.html">Diff::LCS</a>
(diff-lcs). The Ruwiki page still refers to it, but development is not
happening there any longer.
</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
Using this module is quite simple. By default, <a
href="../classes/Diff/LCS.html">Diff::LCS</a> does not extend objects with
the <a href="../classes/Diff/LCS.html">Diff::LCS</a> interface, but will be
called as if it were a function:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'diff/lcs'

  seq1 = %w(a b c e h j l m n p)
  seq2 = %w(b c d e f j k l m r s t)

  lcs = Diff::LCS.LCS(seq1, seq2)
  diffs = Diff::LCS.diff(seq1, seq2)
  sdiff = Diff::LCS.sdiff(seq1, seq2)
  seq = Diff::LCS.traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
  bal = Diff::LCS.traverse_balanced(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
  seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch!(seq1, diffs)
  seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch!(seq2, diffs)
  seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch!(seq1, sdiff)
  seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch!(seq2, sdiff)
</pre>
<p>
Objects can be extended with Diff::LCS:
</p>
<pre>
  seq1.extend(Diff::LCS)
  lcs = seq1.lcs(seq2)
  diffs = seq1.diff(seq2)
  sdiff = seq1.sdiff(seq2)
  seq = seq1.traverse_sequences(seq2, callback_obj)
  bal = seq1.traverse_balanced(seq2, callback_obj)
  seq2 == seq1.patch!(diffs)
  seq1 == seq2.unpatch!(diffs)
  seq2 == seq1.patch!(sdiff)
  seq1 == seq2.unpatch!(sdiff)
</pre>
<p>
By requiring &#8216;diff/lcs/array&#8217; or &#8216;diff/lcs/string&#8217;,
<a href="../classes/Array.html">Array</a> or <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a> will be extended for use this way.
</p>
<p>
Note that <a href="../classes/Diff/LCS.html">Diff::LCS</a> requires a
sequenced enumerable container, which means that the order of enumeration
is both predictable and consistent for the same set of data. While it is
theoretically possible to generate a diff for unordereded hash, it will
only be meaningful if the enumeration of the hashes is consistent. In
general, this will mean that containers that behave like <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a> or <a
href="../classes/Array.html">Array</a> will perform best.
</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>
This software is available under three licenses: the GNU GPL version 2 (or
at your option, a later version), the Perl Artistic license, or the MIT
license. Note that my preference for licensing is the MIT license, but
Algorithm::Diff was dually originally licensed with the Perl Artistic and
the GNU GPL (&#8220;the same terms as Perl itself&#8221;) and that the Ruby
implementation hews pretty closely to the Perl version, so I must maintain
the additional licensing terms.
