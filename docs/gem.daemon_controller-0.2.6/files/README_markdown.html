Introduction
</p>
<h6>======</h6>
<p>
<b>daemon_controller</b> is a library for starting and stopping specific
daemons programmatically in a robust, race-condition-free manner.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not a daemon monitoring system like God or Monit. It&#8217;s
also not a library for writing daemons.
</p>
<p>
It provides the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting daemons. If the daemon fails to start then an exception will be
raised. <b>daemon_controller</b> can even detect failures that occur after
the daemon has already daemonized.

<p>
Starting daemons is done in a race-condition-free manner. If another
process using <b>daemon_controller</b> is trying to start the same daemon,
then <b>daemon_controller</b> will guarantee serialization.
</p>
<p>
<b>daemon_controller</b> also raises an exception if it detects that the
daemon is already started.
</p>
</li>
<li>Connecting to a daemon, starting it if it&#8217;s not already started. This
too is done in a race-condition-free manner. If the daemon fails to start
then an exception will be raised.

</li>
<li>Stopping daemons.

</li>
<li>Checking whether a daemon is running.

</li>
</ul>

What is it for?
</p>
<h6>=========</h6>
<p>
There is a lot of software (both Rails related and unrelated) which rely on
servers or daemons. To name a few, in no particular order:
</p>
<pre>
 * [Ultrasphinx](http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/ultrasphinx/), a
   Rails library for full-text searching. It makes use the [Sphinx search
   software](http://www.sphinxsearch.com/) for indexing and searching. Indexing
   is done by running a command, while searching is done by querying the Sphinx
   search server.
 * [acts_as_ferret](http://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/wiki), another
   Rails library for full-text searching. It uses the Ferret search software.
   On production environments, it relies on the Ferret DRB server for both
   searching and indexing.
 * [BackgrounDRb](http://backgroundrb.rubyforge.org/), a Ruby job server and
   scheduler. Scheduling is done by contacting the BackgrounDRb daemon.
 * [mongrel_cluster](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/wiki/MongrelCluster), which
   starts and stops multiple Mongrel daemons.
</pre>
<p>
Relying on daemons is quite common, but not without problems. Let&#8217;s
go over some of them.
</p>
<p>
### Starting daemons is a hassle
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;ve used similar software, then you might agree that managing
these daemons is a hassle. If you&#8217;re using BackgrounDRb, then the
daemon must be running. Starting the daemon is not hard, but it is
annoying. It&#8217;s also possible that the system administrator forgets to
start the daemon. While configuring the system to automatically start a
daemon at startup is not hard, it is an extra thing to do, and thus a
hassle. We thought, why can&#8217;t such daemons be automatically started?
Indeed, this won&#8217;t be possible if the daemon is to be run on a remote
machine. But in by far the majority of use cases, the daemon runs on the
same host as the Rails application. If a Rails application - or indeed,
<em>any</em> application - is configured to contact a daemon on the local
host, then why not start the daemon automatically on demand?
</p>
<p>
### Daemon starting code may not be robust or efficient
</p>
<p>
We&#8217;ve also observed that people write daemon controlling code over
and over again. Consider for example UltraSphinx, which provides a `rake
sphinx:daemon:start` Rake task to start the daemon. The time that a daemon
needs to initialize is variable, and depends on things such as the current
system load. The Sphinx daemon usually needs less than a second before we
can connect to it. However, the way different software handles starting of
a daemon varies. We&#8217;ve observed that waiting a fixed amount of time
is by far the most common way. For example, UltraSphinx&#8217;s daemon
starting code looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
    system &quot;searchd --config '#{Ultrasphinx::CONF_PATH}'&quot;
    sleep(4) # give daemon a chance to write the pid file
    if ultrasphinx_daemon_running?
       say &quot;started successfully&quot;
    else
       say &quot;failed to start&quot;
    end
</pre>
<p>
This is in no way a slam against UltraSphinx. However, if the daemon starts
in 200 miliseconds, then the user who issued the start command will be
waiting for 3.8 seconds for no good reason. This is not good for usability
or for the user&#8217;s patience.
</p>
<p>
### Startup error handling
</p>
<p>
Different software handles daemon startup errors in different ways. Some
might not even handle errors at all. For example, consider
&#8216;mongrel_cluster&#8217;. If there&#8217;s a typo in one of your
application source files, then &#8216;mongrel_cluster&#8217; will not
report the error. Instead, you have to check its log files to see what
happened. This is not good for usability: many people will be wondering why
they can&#8217;t connect to their Mongrel ports after issuing a
`mongrel_rails cluster::start` - until they realize that they should read
the log file. But the thing is, not everybody realizes this. And typing in
an extra command to read the log file to check whether Mongrel started
correctly, is just a big hassle. Why can&#8217;t the daemon startup code
report such errors immediately?
</p>
<p>
### Stale or corrupt Pid files
</p>
<p>
Suppose that you&#8217;re running a Mongrel cluster, and your server
suddenly powers off because of a power outage. When the server is online
again, it fails to start your Mongrel cluster because the PID file that it
had written still exists, and wasn&#8217;t cleaned up properly (it&#8217;s
supposed to be cleaned up when Mongrel exits). mongrel_cluster provides the
`&#8212;clean` option to check whether the PID file is <b>stale</b>, and
will automatically clean it up if it is. But not all daemon controlling
software supports this. Why can&#8217;t all software check for stale PID
files automatically?
</p>
<p>
## Implementation issues
</p>
<p>
From the problem descriptions, it would become apparent that our wishlist
is as follows. Why is this wishlist often not implemented? Let&#8217;s go
over them.
</p>
<pre>
 -  **A daemon should be automatically started on demand, instead of requiring the user to manually start it.**

    The most obvious problems are related to concurrency. Suppose that your web
    application has a search box, and you want to start the search daemon if it
    isn't already started, then connect to. Two problems will arise:

     *  Suppose that Rails process A is still starting the daemon. At the same
        time, another visitor tries to search something, and Rails process B
        notices that the daemon is not running. If B tries to start the daemon
        while it's already being started by A, then things can go wrong.
        *A robust daemon starter must ensure that only one process at the same time may start the daemon.*
     *  It's not a good idea to wait a fixed amount of time for the daemon to
        start, because you don't know in advance how long it will take for it to
        start. For example, if you wait 2 seconds, then try to connect to the
        daemon, and the daemon isn't done initializing yet, then it will seem as
        if the daemon failed to start.

    These are the most probable reasons why people don't try to write
    auto-starting code, and instead require the user to start the daemon
    manually.

    These problems, as well as several less obvious problems, are closely
    related to the next few points.

 -  **The daemon starter must wait until the daemon is done initializing, no longer and no shorter**

    Because only after the daemon is fully initialized, is it safe to connect
    to it. And because the user should not have to wait longer than he really
    has to. During startup, the daemon will have to be continuously checked
    whether it's done initializing or whether an error occured. Writing this
    code can be quite a hassle, which is why most people don't do it.

 -  **The daemon starter must report any startup errors**

    If the daemon starting command - e.g. `sphinx -c config_file.conf`,
    `apachectl start` or `mongrel_rails cluster::start` - reports startup
    errors, then all is fine as long as the user is starting the command from a
    terminal. A problem occurs when the error occurs after the daemon has
    already gone into the background. Such errors are only reported to the log
    file.
    *The daemon starter should also check the log file for any startup errors.*

    Furthermore, it should be able to raise startup errors as exceptions. This
    allows the the application to decide what to do with the error. For less
    experienced system administrators, the error might be displayed in the
    browser, allowing the administrators to become aware of the problem without
    forcing them to manually check the log files. Or the error might be emailed
    to a system administrator's email address.

 -  **The daemon starter must be able to correct stale or corrupted PID files**

    If the PID file is stale, or for some reason has been corrupted, then the
    daemon starter must be able to cope with that.
    *It should check whether the PID file contains a valid PID, and whether the PID exists.*
</pre>
<p>
Introducing daemon_controller
</p>
<h6>=======================</h6>
<p>
<b>daemon_controller</b> is a library for managing daemons in a robust
manner. It is not a tool for managing daemons. Rather, it is a library
which lets you write applications that manage daemons in a robust manner.
For example, &#8216;mongrel_cluster&#8217; or UltraSphinx may be adapted to
utilize this library, for more robust daemon management.
</p>
<p>
<b>daemon_controller</b> implements all items in the aforementioned
wishlist. It provides the following functionalities:
</p>
<p>
### Starting a daemon
</p>
<p>
This ensures that no two processes can start the same daemon at the same
time. It will also reports any startup errors, even errors that occur after
the daemon has already gone into the background but before it has fully
initialized yet. It also allows you to set a timeout, and will try to abort
the daemon if it takes too long to initialize.
</p>
<p>
The start function won&#8217;t return until the daemon has been fully
initialized, and is responding to connections. So if the start function has
returned, then the daemon is guaranteed to be usable.
</p>
<p>
### Stopping a daemon
</p>
<p>
It will stop the daemon, but only if it&#8217;s already running. Any errors
are reported. If the daemon isn&#8217;t already running, then it will
silently succeed. Just like starting a daemon, you can set a timeout for
stopping the daemon.
</p>
<p>
Like the start function, the stop function won&#8217;t return until the
daemon is no longer running. This makes it save to immediately start the
same daemon again after having stopped it, without worrying that the
previous daemon instance hasn&#8217;t exited yet and might conflict with
the newly started daemon instance.
</p>
<p>
### Connecting to a daemon, starting it if it isn&#8217;t running
</p>
<p>
Every daemon has to be connected to using a different way. As a developer,
you tell &#8216;daemon_controller&#8217; how to connect to the daemon. It
will then attempt to do that, and if that fails, it will check whether the
daemon is running. If it isn&#8217;t running, then it will automatically
start the daemon, and attempt to connect to the daemon again. Failures are
reported.
</p>
<p>
### Checking whether a daemon is running
</p>
<p>
This information is retrieved from the PID file. It also checks whether the
PID file is stale.
</p>
<p>
### All failures are reported via exceptions
</p>
<p>
So that you can exactly determine how you want to handle errors.
</p>
<p>
### Lots and lots of error checking
</p>
<p>
So that there are very few ways in which the system can screw up.
</p>
<p>
daemon_controller&#8217;s goal is to make daemon management less of a
hassle, and as automatic and straightforward as possible.
</p>
<p>
What about Monit/God?
</p>
<h6>===============</h6>
<p>
daemon_controller is not a replacement for [Monit](<a
href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/">www.tildeslash.com/monit/</a>) or
[God](<a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">god.rubyforge.org/</a>). Rather,
it is a solution to the following problem:
</p>
<p>
> *<b>Hongli:</b>* hey Ninh, do a &#8216;git pull&#8217;, I just
implemented awesome searching > features in our application! >
*<b>Ninh:</b>* cool. *pulls from repository* > *<b>Ninh:</b>* hey Hongli,
it doesn&#8217;t work. > *<b>Hongli:</b>* what do you mean, it
doesn&#8217;t work? > *<b>Ninh:</b>* it says &#8220;connection
refused&#8221;, or something > *<b>Hongli:</b>* oh I forgot to mention it,
you have to run the Sphinx search > daemon before it works. type
&#8220;rake sphinx:daemon:start&#8221; to do > that > *<b>Ninh:</b>* great.
but now I get a different error. something about > BackgrounDRb. >
*<b>Hongli:</b>* oops, I forgot to mention this too. you need to start the
> BackgrounDRb server with &#8220;rake backgroundrb:start_server&#8220; >
*<b>Ninh:</b>* okay, so every time I want to use this app, I have to type >
&#8220;rake sphinx:daemon:start&#8221;, &#8220;rake
backgroundrb:start_server&#8220; and > &#8220;./script/server&#8220;? >
*<b>Hongli:</b>* yep
</p>
<p>
Imagine the above conversation becoming just:
</p>
<p>
> *<b>Hongli:</b>* hey Ninh, do a &#8216;git pull&#8217;, I just
implemented awesome searching > features in our application! >
*<b>Ninh:</b>* cool. *pulls from repository* > *<b>Ninh:</b>* awesome, it
works!
</p>
<p>
This is not something that can be achieved with Monit/God. Monit/God are
for monitoring daemons, auto-restarting them when they use too much
resources. daemon_controller&#8217;s goal is to allow developers to
implement daemon starting/stopping and daemon auto-starting code
that&#8217;s robust. daemon_controller is intended to be used to make
daemon-dependent applications Just Work(tm) without having to start the
daemons manually.
</p>
<p>
Tutorial 1: controlling Apache
</p>
<h6>=========================</h6>
<p>
Suppose that you&#8217;re a [Phusion Passenger](<a
href="http://www.modrails.com/">www.modrails.com/</a>) developer, and you
need to write tests for the Apache module. In particular, you want to test
whether the different Phusion Passenger configuration directives are
working as expected. Obviously, to test the Apache module, the Apache web
server must be running. For every test, you will want the unit test suite
to:
</p>
<pre>
 1. Write an Apache configuration file, with the relevant configuration
    directive set to a specific value.
 2. Start Apache.
 3. Send an HTTP request to Apache and check whether the HTTP response matches
    your expectations.
 4. Stop Apache.
</pre>
<p>
That can be done with the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'daemon_controller'

    File.open(&quot;apache.conf&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) do |f|
       f.write(&quot;PidFile apache.pid\n&quot;)
       f.write(&quot;LogFile apache.log\n&quot;)
       f.write(&quot;Listen 1234\n&quot;)
       f.write(... other relevant configuration options ...)
    end

    controller = DaemonController.new(
       :identifier    =&gt; 'Apache web server',
       :start_command =&gt; 'apachectl -f apache.conf -k start',
       :ping_command  =&gt; lambda { TCPSocket.new('localhost', 1234) },
       :pid_file      =&gt; 'apache.pid',
       :log_file      =&gt; 'apache.log',
       :start_timeout =&gt; 25
    )
    controller.start

    .... apache is now started ....
    .... some test code here ....

    controller.stop
</pre>
<p>
The `File.open` line is obvious: it writes the relevant Apache
configuration file.
</p>
<p>
The next line is for creating a new <a
href="../classes/DaemonController.html">DaemonController</a> object. We
pass a human-readable identifier for this daemon (&#8220;Apache web
server&#8221;) to the constructor. This is used for generating friendlier
error messages. We also tell it how Apache is supposed to be started
(`:start_command`), how to check whether it can be connected to
(`:ping_command`), and where its PID file and log file is. If Apache failed
with an error during startup, then it will be reported. If Apache failed
with an error after it has gone into the background, then that will be
reported too: the given log file is monitored for new error messages.
Finally, a timeout of 25 seconds is given. If Apache doesn&#8217;t start
within 25 seconds, then an exception will be raised.
</p>
<p>
The ping command is just a `Proc` which returns true or false. If the Proc
raises `Errno::ECONNREFUSED`, then that&#8217;s also interpreted by <a
href="../classes/DaemonController.html">DaemonController</a> as meaning
that the daemon isn&#8217;t responding yet.
</p>
<p>
After `controller.start` has returned, we can continue with the test case.
At this point, we know that Apache is done with initializing. When
we&#8217;re done with Apache, we stop it with `controller.stop`. This does
not return until Apache has fully stopped.
</p>
<p>
The cautious reader might notice that the socket returned by the ping
command is never closed. That&#8217;s true, because <a
href="../classes/DaemonController.html">DaemonController</a> will close it
automatically for us, if it notices that the ping command proc&#8217;s
return value responds to `close`.
</p>
<p>
From this example, it becomes apparent that for daemon_controller to work,
you must know how to start the daemon, how to contact the daemon, and you
must know where it will put its PID file and log file.
</p>
<p>
Tutorial 2: Sphinx indexing and search server management
</p>
<h6>===================================================</h6>
<p>
We at Phusion are currently developing a web application with full-text
search capabilities, and we&#8217;re using Sphinx for this purpose. We want
to make the lives of our developers and our system administrators as easy
as possible, so that there&#8217;s little room for human screw-up, and so
we&#8217;ve developed this library. Our Sphinx search daemon is completely
managed through this library and is automatically started on demand.
</p>
<p>
Our Sphinx config file is generated from an ERB template. This ERB template
writes different values in the config file, depending on whether
we&#8217;re in development, test or production mode. We will want to
regenerate this config file every time, just before we start the search
daemon. But there&#8217;s more. The search daemon will fail if there is no
search index. If a new developer has just checked out the
application&#8217;s source code, then there is no search index yet. We
don&#8217;t want him to go through the pain of having to generate the index
manually. (That said, it isn&#8217;t that much of a pain, but it&#8217;s
just yet-another-thing to do, which can and should be automated.) So before
starting the daemon, we will also want to check whether the index exists.
If not, then we&#8217;ll generate it, and then start the daemon. Of course,
no two Rails processes may generate the config file or the index at the
same time.
</p>
<p>
When querying the search server, we will want to automatically start it if
it isn&#8217;t running.
</p>
<p>
This can be achieved with the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    require 'daemon_controller'

    class SearchServer
       SEARCH_SERVER_PORT = 1234

       def initialize
          @controller = DaemonController.new(
             :identifier =&gt; 'Sphinx search server',
             :start_command =&gt; &quot;searchd -c config/sphinx.conf&quot;,
             :before_start =&gt; method(:before_start),
             :ping_command =&gt; lambda { TCPSocket.new('localhost', SEARCH_SERVER_PORT) },
             :pid_file =&gt; 'tmp/pids/sphinx.pid',
             :log_file =&gt; 'log/sphinx.log')
       end

       def query(search_terms)
          socket = @controller.connect do
             TCPSocket.new('localhost', SEARCH_SERVER_PORT)
          end
          send_query(socket, search_terms)
          return retrieve_results(socket)
       end

    private
       def before_start
          generate_configuration_file
          if !index_exists?
             generate_index
          end
       end

       ...
    end
</pre>
<p>
Notice the `:before_start` option. We pass a block of code which is to be
run, just before the daemon is started. This block, along with starting the
daemon, is completely serialized. That is, if you&#8217;re inside the
block, then it&#8217;s guaranteed that no other process is running this
block at the same time as well.
</p>
<p>
The `query` method is the method for querying the search server with search
terms. It returns a list of result. It uses `<a
href="../classes/DaemonController.html#M000007">DaemonController#connect</a>`:
one passes a block of that method, which contains code for connecting to
the daemon. If the block returns nil, or if it raises
`Errno::ECONNREFUSED`, then `<a
href="../classes/DaemonController.html#M000007">DaemonController#connect</a>`
will automatically take care of auto-starting the Sphinx daemon for us.
</p>
<p>
A little bit of history
</p>
<h6>=================</h6>
<p>
The issue of managing daemons has been a thorn in our eyes for quite some
time now. Until now, we&#8217;ve solved this problem by equipping any
daemons that we write with the ability to gracefully handle being
concurrently started, the ability to initialize as much as possible
<b>before</b> forking into the background, etc. However, equipping all this
robustness into our code over and over is a lot of work. We&#8217;ve
considered documenting a standard behavior for daemons so that they can
properly support auto-starting and such.
</p>
<p>
However, we&#8217;ve recently realized that that&#8217;s probably a futile
effort. Convincing everybody to write a lot of code for a bit more
robustness is probably not realistic. So we took the pragmatic approach and
developed a library which adds more robustness on top of daemons&#8217;
existing behavior. And thus, daemon_controller was born. It is a little bit
less efficient compared to when the daemon is designed from the beginning
with such abilities in mind, but it&#8217;s compatible with virtually all
daemons, and is easy to use.
</p>
<p>
Concurrency notes
</p>
<h6>===========</h6>
<p>
<a href="../classes/DaemonController.html">DaemonController</a> can only
guarantee concurrency safety between multiple threads in the same process,
if all of those threads use the same <a
href="../classes/DaemonController.html">DaemonController</a> object.
Synchronization between multiple processes works fine.
