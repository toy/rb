</p>
<ul>
<li>HttpStream patches merged in from Luke Redpath <contact@lukeredpath.co.uk>

</li>
<li>Changed how <a href="../classes/Yajl/Parser.html">Yajl::Parser</a> was
calling IO#read to better conform to the Rack spec and thus can be used to
directly parse a rack.input stream

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.6.8 (January 1st, 2010)
</p>
<ul>
<li>A couple of small performance patches

</li>

of only a URI

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.6.7 (December 4th, 2009)

<ul>
<li>Bump internal version constant to the proper value (doh!)

</li>
<li>Bring over latest from <a href="../classes/Yajl.html">Yajl</a> upstream

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.6.6 (December 1st, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brought over some optimizations from Macruby&#8217;s use of some yajl-ruby
codez

</p>
<ul>
<li>All specs pass on Rubinius :)

</li>
<li>Added <a href="../classes/Yajl.html#M000030">Yajl.load</a> and <a
href="../classes/Yajl.html#M000031">Yajl.dump</a> for compatibility with
other various data format API&#8217;s in ruby

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in <a href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html">Yajl::Encoder</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.6.2 (August 25th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug surfaced by an existing library providing a to_json method, and
<a href="../classes/Yajl.html">Yajl</a> would double-quote the values
provided

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.6.1 (August 20th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a> where responses
contained multiple <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> strings but
weren&#8217;t Transfer-Encoding: chunked (thanks @dacort!)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.6.0 (August 19th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added POST, PUT and DELETE support to <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** POST support initially contributed by jdg (<a
href="http://github.com/jdg">github.com/jdg</a>) - Although oortle (<a
href="http://github.com/oortle">github.com/oortle</a>) coded it up in a
fork with it as well.
</p>
<p>
## 0.5.12 (July 31st, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add another option that can be passed to Yajl::Encoder&#8217;s constructor
(:terminator) to allow the caller some control over when a full <a
href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> string has been generated by the
encoder. More information on it&#8217;s use in the README

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.11 (July 14th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixing a bug Aman found with to_json on non-primitive Ruby objects and
double-quoting in the <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> compat API

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.10 (July 13th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for the <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> gem compatibility
API&#8217;s default <a
href="../classes/Object.html#M000011">Object#to_json</a> helper

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.9 (July 9th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for <a href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html">Yajl::Encoder</a> where
encoding a hash like {:a => :b} would get stuck in an infinite loop

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.8 (July 6th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix in <a href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a>
for proper handling of the Content-type header (Rob Sharp)

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html">Yajl::Encoder</a> now has an
on_progress callback setter, which can be used to harness the
encoder&#8217;s streaming ability.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** The passed Proc/lambda will be called, and passed every chunk (currently
8kb) of the encoded <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> string as
it&#8217;s being encoded.
</p>
<ul>
<li>API CHANGE WARNING: <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html#M000033">Yajl::Encoder.encode</a>&#8217;s
block will now be used as (and work the same as) the on_progress callback

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** This means the block will be passed chunks of the <a
href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> string at a time, giving the caller
the ability to start processing the encoded data while it&#8217;s still
being encoded.
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed grammatical error in README (Neil Berkman)

</li>
<li>Added some encoder examples

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.7 (June 23rd, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now pass parser options (like :symbolize_keys for example) to <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html#M000015">Yajl::HttpStream.get</a>

</li>
<li>Refactored spec tests a bit, DRYing up the <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a> specs quite a
bit.

</li>
<li>Added a spec rake task, and spec.opts file

</li>
<li>Updated and renamed rcov rake task, and added rcov.opts file

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.6 (June 19th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="../classes/JSON.html#M000021">JSON.default_options</a> hash
to the <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> gem compatibility API

</li>
<li>Split out the <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> gem compatibility
API&#8217;s parsing and encoding methods into individually includable files

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** the use case here is if you <b>only</b> want parsing, or <b>only</b>
want encoding ** also, if you don&#8217;t include encoding it won&#8217;t
include the to_json overrides which tend to cause problems in some
environments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed some large benchmark test files to reduce the size of the packaged
gem by 1.5MB!

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.5 (June 17th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of the <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> gem
compatibility API

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** NOTE: this isn&#8217;t a 1:1 compatibility API, the goal was to be
compatible with as many of the projects using the <a
href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> gem as possible - not the <a
href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> gem API itself ** the compatibility
API must be explicitly enabled by requiring &#8216;yajl/json_gem&#8217; in
your project ** <a href="../classes/JSON.html#M000022">JSON.parse</a>, <a
href="../classes/JSON.html#M000012">JSON.generate</a>, and the to_json
instance method extension to ruby&#8217;s primitive classes are all
included
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix <a href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html">Yajl::Encoder</a> to ensure map
keys are strings

</li>
<li>Encoding multiple <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> objects to a
single stream doesn&#8217;t separate by a newline character anymore

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html">Yajl::Encoder</a> now checks for the
existence of, and will call to_json on any non-primitive object

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.4 (June 16th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Yajl::Parser&#8217;s :symbolize_keys option now defaults to false

</li>
<li>remove use of sprintf for a little speed improvement while parsing

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.3 (June 7th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>The IO parameter for Yajl::Encode#encode is now optional, and accepts a
block

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** it will return the resulting <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a>
string if no IO is passed to stream to ** if a block is passed, it will
call and pass it the resulting <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a>
string
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/Yajl/Parser.html#M000032">Yajl::Parser#parse</a> can
now parse from a String as well as an IO

</li>
<li>Added and updated lot of in-code documentation.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** all the C code exposed to Ruby should now have comments
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added :symbolize_keys option to the <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Parser.html">Yajl::Parser</a> class, which defaults
to true.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** Having this option enabled has shown around an 18% speedup in parsing
time according to my benchmarks
</p>
<p>
## 0.5.2 (May 30th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added class helper methods <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html#M000033">Yajl::Encoder.encode</a>(obj,
io) and <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Parser.html#M000032">Yajl::Parser.parse(io)</a>

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * added tests for the above
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Updated Twitter streaming example to have a less verbose output

</li>
<li>Patch <a href="../classes/Yajl.html">Yajl</a> so encoding can continue as a
stream

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * IE: multiple objects encoded onto the same IO
 * added a test for the above
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Set the internal read buffer size back down to 8kb by default

</li>
<li>Added an internal write buffer size (set to 8kb by default) which is used
to throttle writes to the output stream

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * This is to fix a major performance bug/issue with the IO#write C method in ruby 1.9.x (I've opened a bug with them about it)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a typo in a one-off parsing spec test

</li>
<li>Updated benchmarks to work properly in 1.9 (required removal ActiveSupport
benchmarking for now)

</li>
<li>Updated spec tests to respect ridiculous differences in hash key ordering
between 1.8 and 1.9

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.1 (May 25th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>added some more tests for the new API

</li>
<li>inlined a couple of hot functions used in parsing for a little speedup

</li>
<li>updates to readme, reflecting changes in API

</li>
<li>version bump to push another gem build

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.5.0 (May 25th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored internal API so the caller can specify initialization options
for the Parser and Encoder respectively. Two new classes were introduced as
a result - <a href="../classes/Yajl/Parser.html">Yajl::Parser</a> and <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Encoder.html">Yajl::Encoder</a>. The newly refactored
codebase is cleaner, thread-safe and removed all of the hack-code that was
trickled around to make things work in the previous implementation.
She&#8217;s much more seaworthy now cap&#8217;n!

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * Yajl::Parser.new accepts two options, :allow_comments and :check_utf8 which both default to true
 * Yajl::Encoder.new accepts two options, :pretty and :indent which default to false and &quot;  &quot; respectively
</pre>
<ul>
<li>cleaned up a lot of state code, that to my knowledge prevented yajl-ruby
from being used in a thread-safe environment.

</li>
<li>added deprecated messaging to Yajl::Stream.parse and Yajl::Stream.encode -
these will likely go away before 0.6.0

</li>
<li>fixed a bug in the chunked http response parser regarding partially
received chunks

</li>
<li>added a Twitter Search API example showing off the HttpStream API

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.4.9 (May 20th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed some parser state bugs surfaced by edge cases

</li>
<li>added support for Chunked HTTP response bodies in <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a>

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * added support for passing a block to Yajl::HttpStream.get that will be used as a callback whenever a JSON object is parsed off the stream (even if there is more than one!)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>added an examples folder, and put an example using the Twitter Streaming
API in there to start

</li>
<li>added some more spec tests, this time around Chunked parsing and
continuously parsing multiple <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a>
strings

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.4.8 (May 18th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed a totally bone-head compilation problem, I created for myself ;)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.4.7 (May 18th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bundling <a href="../classes/Yajl.html">Yajl</a> sources to remove the need
to install them (and CMake) separately (Thank you Lloyd!!!) This means you
can now simply install the gem and be off and running

</li>
<li>Added some spec tests for <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a>

</li>
<li>Added some spec tests for Yajl::Stream.encode

</li>
<li>added some more thank you&#8217;s, where credit&#8217;s due - in the readme

</li>
<li>updated the unicode.json file to reflect a &#8220;real-life&#8221; <a
href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> response

</li>
<li>reorganized spec tests into their functional areas

</li>
<li>added an rcov rake task to generate code coverage output

</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>

</pre>
<ul>

</li>
<li>changed the compiled extension to have a more specific name (yajl_ext) for
easier loading

</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.4.4 (May 12th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: Breaking API change:

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * renamed Yajl::GzipStreamReader to Yajl::Gzip::StreamReader
</pre>
<ul>
<li>added <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Bzip2/StreamReader.html">Yajl::Bzip2::StreamReader</a>

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * depends on the bzip2-ruby gem if you want to use it, if not Yajl::Bzip2 won't be loaded
</pre>
<ul>
<li>added <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Deflate/StreamReader.html">Yajl::Deflate::StreamReader</a>

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * actually uses Zlib::Inflate for stream decompression
</pre>
<ul>
<li>added parse(io) class methods to <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Gzip/StreamReader.html">Yajl::Gzip::StreamReader</a>
and <a
href="../classes/Yajl/Bzip2/StreamReader.html">Yajl::Bzip2::StreamReader</a>
as a helper for parsing compressed streams.

</li>
<li>updated <a href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a> to
request responses compressed as deflate and bzip2 in addition to gzip

</li>
<li>fixed a bug regarding parsing Integers as Floats (so 123456 would have be
parsed and returned as 123456.0)

</li>
<li>fixed a bug which caused a segfault in ruby&#8217;s GC during string
replacement in <a href="../classes/Yajl/Gzip.html">Yajl::Gzip</a> and
Yajl::Bzip2&#8217;s StreamReader#read methods

</li>
<li>added support for user-specified User-Agent strings in <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>adding text/plain as an allowed mime-type for <a
href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a> for webservers
that respond with it instead of application/json (ahem...Yelp...)

</li>
<li>renamed specs folder to spec for no reason at all

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.4.2 (April 30th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a> is now
sending &#8220;proper&#8221; http request headers

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a> will request
HTTP-Basic auth if credentials are provided in the passed URI

</li>
<li>cleanup requires

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.4.1 (April 30th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed a typo in the stream.rb benchmark file

</li>
<li>fixed a bug in Yajl::Stream.parse that was causing &#8220;strange&#8221;
Ruby malloc errors on large files, with large strings

</li>
<li>added Yajl::GzipStreamReader as a wrapper around Zlib::GzipReader to allow
for standard IO#read behavior

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * this allows Yajl::Stream to read off of a Gzip stream directly
</pre>
<p>
## 0.4.0 (April 29th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: Breaking API change:

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * refactored Stream parsing methods out of Yajl::Native into Yajl::Stream
 * removed Yajl::Native namespace/module
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Addition of <a href="../classes/Yajl/HttpStream.html">Yajl::HttpStream</a>
module

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * This module is for streaming JSON HTTP responses directly into Yajl (as they're being received) for increased awesomeness
 * it currently supports basic get requests with Yajl::HttpStream.get(uri)
 * it also supports (and prefers) output compressed (gzip) responses
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Addition Yajl::Chunked module

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * This module is for feeding Yajl JSON pieces at a time, instead of an entire IO object
 * This works very well in environments like an EventMachine app where data is received in chunks by design
</pre>
<ul>
<li>decreased read buffer for Yajl::Stream from 8kb to 4kb

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.3.4 (April 24th, 2009)
</p>
<ul>
<li>turned Unicode checks back on in the <a
href="../classes/Yajl.html">Yajl</a> parser now that it&#8217;s fixed
(thanks Lloyd!)

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * this also bumps the yajl version dependency requirement to 1.0.4
</pre>
<ul>
<li>better guessing of Integer/Float from number found instead of just trying
to create a BigNum no matter what

</li>
<li>changed extconf.rb to fail Makefile creation if yajl isn&#8217;t found

</li>
<li>added a test to check for parsing Infinity due to a Float overflow

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.3.3 (April 24th, 2009)
</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.3.1 (April 23rd, 2009)

</p>
<ul>
<li>slight refactor of ActiveSupport tests to better reflect how they actually
exist in ActiveSupport

</li>
<li>typo correction in the changelog which had the years in 2008

</li>
<li>added some initial spec tests

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 * ported some from ActiveSupport to ensure proper compatibility
 * included 57 JSON fixtures to test against, all of which pass
</pre>
<ul>
<li>changed parser config to not check for invalid unicode characters as Ruby
is going to do this anyway (?). This resolves the remaining test failures
around unicode.

</li>
<li>changed how the parser was dealing with numbers to prevent overflows

</li>
<li>added an exception class Yajl::ParseError which is now used in place of
simply printing to STDERR upon a parsing error

</li>
<li>renamed a couple of <a href="../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> test files in
the benchmark folder to better represent their contents

</li>
<li>misc README updates

</li>
</ul>
<p>

href="../classes/Yajl.html">Yajl</a> itself)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.2.0 (April 22nd, 2009)
