<pre>
  * Major Enhancements
    * Add support for parsing git notes.

      commands
    * Grit::Git#native takes an :env option for setting the git child
      process's
      environment without futsing with the parent's environment.
    * Grit::Git#native takes an :chdir option for setting the current working
      directory (PWD) of the git child process.
