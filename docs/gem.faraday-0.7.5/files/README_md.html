<p>
Modular HTTP client library using middleware heavily inspired by Rack.
</p>
<p>
This mess is gonna get raw, like sushi. So, haters to the left.
</p>
<p>
Usage
</p>
<hr size="3"></hr><pre>
    conn = Faraday.new(:url =&gt; 'http://sushi.com') do |builder|
      builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded  # convert request params as &quot;www-form-urlencoded&quot;
      builder.use Faraday::Request::JSON        # encode request params as json
      builder.use Faraday::Response::Logger     # log the request to STDOUT
      builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp     # make http requests with Net::HTTP

      # or, use shortcuts:
      builder.request  :url_encoded
      builder.request  :json
      builder.response :logger
      builder.adapter  :net_http
    end

    ## GET ##

    response = conn.get '/nigiri/sake.json'     # GET http://sushi.com/nigiri/sake.json
    response.body

    conn.get '/nigiri', 'X-Awesome' =&gt; true     # custom request header

    conn.get do |req|                           # GET http://sushi.com/search?page=2&amp;limit=100
      req.url '/search', :page =&gt; 2
      req.params['limit'] = 100
    end

    ## POST ##

    conn.post '/nigiri', { :name =&gt; 'Maguro' }  # POST &quot;name=maguro&quot; to http://sushi.com/nigiri

    # post payload as JSON instead of &quot;www-form-urlencoded&quot; encoding:
    conn.post '/nigiri', payload, 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'application/json'

    # a more verbose way:
    conn.post do |req|
      req.url '/nigiri'
      req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
      req.body = { :name =&gt; 'Unagi' }
    end
</pre>
<p>
If you&#8217;re ready to roll with just the bare minimum:
</p>
<pre>
    # default stack (net/http), no extra middleware:
    response = Faraday.get 'http://sushi.com/nigiri/sake.json'
</pre>
<p>
Advanced middleware usage
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
The order in which middleware is stacked is important. Like with Rack, the
first middleware on the list wraps all others, while the last middleware is
the innermost one, so that&#8217;s usually the adapter.
</p>
<pre>
    conn = Faraday.new(:url =&gt; 'http://sushi.com') do |builder|
      # POST/PUT params encoders:
      builder.request  :multipart
      builder.request  :url_encoded
      builder.request  :json

      builder.adapter  :net_http
    end
</pre>
<p>
This request middleware setup affects POST/PUT requests in the following
way:
</p>
<ol>
<li>`Request::Multipart` checks for files in the payload, otherwise leaves
everything untouched;

</li>
<li>`Request::UrlEncoded` encodes as
&#8220;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#8221; if not already encoded or
of another type

</li>
<li>`Request::JSON` encodes as &#8220;application/json&#8220; if not already
encoded or of another type

</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because &#8220;UrlEncoded&#8221; is higher on the stack than JSON encoder,
it will get to process the request first. Swapping them means giving the
other priority. Specifying the &#8220;Content-Type&#8221; for the request
is explicitly stating which middleware should process it.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
    payload = { :name =&gt; 'Maguro' }

    # post payload as JSON instead of urlencoded:
    conn.post '/nigiri', payload, 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'application/json'

    # uploading a file:
    payload = { :profile_pic =&gt; Faraday::UploadIO.new('avatar.jpg', 'image/jpeg') }

    # &quot;Multipart&quot; middleware detects files and encodes with &quot;multipart/form-data&quot;:
    conn.put '/profile', payload
</pre>
<p>
Writing middleware
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
Middleware are classes that respond to `call()`. They wrap the
request/response cycle.
</p>
<pre>
    def call(env)
      # do something with the request

      @app.call(env).on_complete do
        # do something with the response
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
It&#8217;s important to do all processing of the response only in the
`on_complete` block. This enables middleware to work in parallel mode where
requests are asynchronous.
</p>
<p>
The `env` is a hash with symbol keys that contains info about the request
and, later, response. Some keys are:
</p>
<pre>
    # request phase
    :method - :get, :post, ...
    :url    - URI for the current request; also contains GET parameters
    :body   - POST parameters for :post/:put requests
    :request_headers

    # response phase
    :status - HTTP response status code, such as 200
    :body   - the response body
    :response_headers
</pre>
<p>
Testing
</p>
<hr size="5"></hr><pre>
    # It's possible to define stubbed request outside a test adapter block.
    stubs = Faraday::Adapter::Test::Stubs.new do |stub|
      stub.get('/tamago') { [200, {}, 'egg'] }
    end

    # You can pass stubbed request to the test adapter or define them in a block
    # or a combination of the two.
    test = Faraday.new do |builder|
      builder.adapter :test, stubs do |stub|
        stub.get('/ebi') {[ 200, {}, 'shrimp' ]}
      end
    end

    # It's also possible to stub additional requests after the connection has
    # been initialized. This is useful for testing.
    stubs.get('/uni') {[ 200, {}, 'urchin' ]}

    resp = test.get '/tamago'
    resp.body # =&gt; 'egg'
    resp = test.get '/ebi'
    resp.body # =&gt; 'shrimp'
    resp = test.get '/uni'
    resp.body # =&gt; 'urchin'
    resp = test.get '/else' #=&gt; raises &quot;no such stub&quot; error

    # If you like, you can treat your stubs as mocks by verifying that all of
    # the stubbed calls were made. NOTE that this feature is still fairly
    # experimental: It will not verify the order or count of any stub, only that
    # it was called once during the course of the test.
    stubs.verify_stubbed_calls
</pre>
<p>
TODO
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><ul>
<li>support streaming requests/responses

</li>
<li>better stubbing API

</li>
<li>Support timeouts

</li>
<li>Add curb, em-http, fast_http

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note on Patches/Pull Requests
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><ul>
<li>Fork the project.

</li>
<li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.

</li>
<li>Add tests for it. This is important so I don&#8217;t break it in a future
version unintentionally.

</li>
<li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to
have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself
I can ignore when I pull)

</li>
<li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

</li>
</ul>

Supported Rubies
</p>
<hr size="10"></hr><p>
This library aims to support and is [tested against](<a
href="http://travis-ci.org/technoweenie/faraday">travis-ci.org/technoweenie/faraday</a>)
the following Ruby implementations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 1.8.7

</li>
<li>Ruby 1.9.1

</li>
<li>Ruby 1.9.2

</li>
<li>[Rubinius](<a href="http://rubini.us">rubini.us</a>)

</li>
<li>[Ruby Enterprise Edition](<a
href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/</a>)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
If something doesn&#8217;t work on one of these interpreters, it should be
considered a bug.
</p>
<p>
This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions
listed above.
</p>
<p>
If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all
tests run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in
a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist
at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be
dropped.
