 = EM::Completion

 A completion is a callback container for various states of completion. In
 it's most basic form it has a start state and a finish state.

 This implementation includes some hold-back from the EM::Deferrable
 interface in order to be compatible - but it has a much cleaner
 implementation.

 In general it is preferred that this implementation be used as a state
 callback container than EM::DefaultDeferrable or other classes including
 EM::Deferrable. This is because it is generally more sane to keep this level
 of state in a dedicated state-back container. This generally leads to more
 malleable interfaces and software designs, as well as eradicating nasty bugs
 that result from abstraction leakage.

 == Basic Usage

 As already mentioned, the basic usage of a Completion is simply for its two
 final states, :succeeded and :failed.

 An asynchronous operation will complete at some future point in time, and
 users often want to react to this event. API authors will want to expose
 some common interface to react to these events.

 In the following example, the user wants to know when a short lived
 connection has completed its exchange with the remote server. The simple
 protocol just waits for an ack to its message.

    class Protocol &lt; EM::Connection
      include EM::P::LineText2

      def initialize(message, completion)
        @message, @completion = message, completion
        @completion.completion { close_connection }
        @completion.timeout(1, :timeout)
      end

      def post_init
        send_data(@message)
      end

      def receive_line(line)
        case line
        when /ACK/i
          @completion.succeed line
        when /ERR/i
          @completion.fail :error, line
        else
          @completion.fail :unknown, line
        end
      end

      def unbind
        @completion.fail :disconnected unless @completion.completed?
      end
    end

    class API
      attr_reader :host, :port

      def initialize(host = 'example.org', port = 8000)
        @host, @port = host, port
      end

      def request(message)
        completion = EM::Deferrable::Completion.new
        EM.connect(host, port, Protocol, message, completion)
        completion
      end
    end

    api = API.new
    completion = api.request('stuff')
    completion.callback do |line|
      puts &quot;API responded with: #{line}&quot;
    end
    completion.errback do |type, line|
      case type
      when :error
        puts &quot;API error: #{line}&quot;
      when :unknown
        puts &quot;API returned unknown response: #{line}&quot;
      when :disconnected
        puts &quot;API server disconnected prematurely&quot;
      when :timeout
        puts &quot;API server did not respond in a timely fashion&quot;
      end
    end

 == Advanced Usage

 This completion implementation also supports more state callbacks and
 arbitrary states (unlike the original Deferrable API). This allows for basic
 stateful process encapsulation. One might use this to setup state callbacks
 for various states in an exchange like in the basic usage example, except
 where the applicaiton could be made to react to &quot;connected&quot; and
 &quot;disconnected&quot; states additionally.

    class Protocol &lt; EM::Connection
      def initialize(completion)
        @response = []
        @completion = completion
        @completion.stateback(:disconnected) do
          @completion.succeed @response.join
        end
      end

      def connection_completed
        @host, @port = Socket.unpack_sockaddr_in get_peername
        @completion.change_state(:connected, @host, @port)
        send_data(&quot;GET http://example.org/ HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n&quot;)
      end

      def receive_data(data)
        @response &lt;&lt; data
      end

      def unbind
        @completion.change_state(:disconnected, @host, @port)
      end
    end

    completion = EM::Deferrable::Completion.new
    completion.stateback(:connected) do |host, port|
      puts &quot;Connected to #{host}:#{port}&quot;
    end
    completion.stateback(:disconnected) do |host, port|
      puts &quot;Disconnected from #{host}:#{port}&quot;
    end
    completion.callback do |response|
      puts response
    end

    EM.connect('example.org', 80, Protocol, completion)

 == Timeout

 The Completion also has a timeout. The timeout is global and is not aware of
 states apart from completion states. The timeout is only engaged if #timeout
 is called, and it will call fail if it is reached.

 == Completion states

 By default there are two completion states, :succeeded and :failed. These
 states can be modified by subclassing and overrding the #completion_states
 method. Completion states are special, in that callbacks for all completion
 states are explcitly cleared when a completion state is entered. This
 prevents errors that could arise from accidental unterminated timeouts, and
 other such user errors.

 == Other notes

 Several APIs have been carried over from EM::Deferrable for compatibility
 reasons during a transitionary period. Specifically cancel_errback and
 cancel_callback are implemented, but their usage is to be strongly
 discouraged. Due to the already complex nature of reaction systems, dynamic
 callback deletion only makes the problem much worse. It is always better to
 add correct conditionals to the callback code, or use more states, than to
 address such implementaiton issues with conditional callbacks.
