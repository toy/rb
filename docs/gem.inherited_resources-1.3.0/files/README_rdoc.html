        <h2>Inherited Resources</h2>
<p>
Inherited Resources speeds up development by making your controllers
inherit all restful actions so you just have to focus on what is important.
It makes your controllers more powerful and cleaner at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Plus, making your controllers follow a pattern, it helps you to write
better code by following fat models and skinny controllers convention.
There are two screencasts available besides this README:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/230-inherited-resources">railscasts.com/episodes/230-inherited-resources</a>

</li>
<li><a
href="http://akitaonrails.com/2009/09/01/screencast-real-thin-restful-controllers-with-inherited-resources">akitaonrails.com/2009/09/01/screencast-real-thin-restful-controllers-with-inherited-resources</a>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3><a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 3</h3>
<p>
You can let bundler install Inherited Resources by adding this line to your
application&#8217;s Gemfile:
</p>
<pre>
  gem 'inherited_resources'
</pre>
<p>
And then execute:
</p>
<pre>
  bundle install
</pre>
<p>
Or install it yourself as:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install inherited_resources
</pre>
<h3><a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3.x</h3>
<p>
If you want to use the <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3.x
version, you should install:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install inherited_resources --version=1.0.6
</pre>
<p>
Or checkout from the v1.0 branch:
</p>
<pre>
  http://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources/tree/v1.0
</pre>
<h2>HasScope</h2>
<p>
Since Inherited Resources 1.0, has_scope is not part of its core anymore
but a gem dependency. Be sure to check the documentation to see how you can
use it:
</p>
<pre>
  http://github.com/plataformatec/has_scope
</pre>
<p>
And it can be installed as:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install has_scope
</pre>
<h2>Responders</h2>
<p>
Since Inherited Resources 1.0, responders are not part of its core anymore,
but is set as Inherited Resources dependency and it&#8217;s used by default
by <a href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a>
controllers. Be sure to check the documentation to see how it will change
your application:
</p>
<pre>
  http://github.com/plataformatec/responders
</pre>
<p>
And it can be installed as:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install responders
</pre>
<p>
Using responders will set the flash message to :notice and :alert. You can
change that through the following configuration value:
</p>
<pre>
  InheritedResources.flash_keys = [ :success, :failure ]
</pre>
<p>
Notice the CollectionResponder won&#8217;t work with <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a>, as <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a> hardcodes
the redirect path based on the current scope (like belongs to, polymorphic
associations, etc).
</p>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>
To use Inherited Resources you just have to inherit (duh) it:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
    end
</pre>
<p>
And all actions are defined and working, check it! Your projects collection
(in the index action) is still available in the instance variable @projects
and your project resource (all other actions) is available as @project.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to define which mime types this controller provides:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      respond_to :html, :xml, :json
    end
</pre>
<p>
You can also specify them based per action:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      respond_to :html, :xml, :json
      respond_to :js, :only =&gt; :create
      respond_to :iphone, :except =&gt; [ :edit, :update ]
    end
</pre>
<p>
For each request, it first checkes if the
&#8220;controller/action.format&#8220; file is available (for example
&#8220;projects/create.xml&#8220;) and if it&#8217;s not, it checks if the
resource respond to :to_format (in this case, :to_xml). Otherwise returns
404.
</p>
<p>
Another option is to specify which actions the controller will inherit from
the InheritedResources::Base:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      actions :index, :show, :new, :create
    end
</pre>
<p>
Or:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      actions :all, :except =&gt; [ :edit, :update, :destroy ]
    end
</pre>
<p>
In your views, you will get the following helpers:
</p>
<pre>
    resource        #=&gt; @project
    collection      #=&gt; @projects
    resource_class  #=&gt; Project
</pre>
<p>
As you might expect, collection (@projects instance variable) is only
available on index actions.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason you cannot inherit from InheritedResources::Base, you
can call inherit_resources in your controller class scope:
</p>
<pre>
    class AccountsController &lt; ApplicationController
      inherit_resources
    end
</pre>
<h2>Overwriting defaults</h2>
<p>
Whenever you inherit from <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a>, several
defaults are assumed. For example you can have an AccountsController to
account management while the resource is an User:
</p>
<pre>
    class AccountsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      defaults :resource_class =&gt; User, :collection_name =&gt; 'users', :instance_name =&gt; 'user'
    end
</pre>
<p>
In the case above, in your views you will have @users and @user variables,
but the routes used will still be accounts_url and account_url. If you plan
also to change the routes, you can use :route_collection_name and
:route_instance_name.
</p>
<p>
Namespaced controllers work out of the box, but if you need to specify a
different route prefix, you can do the following:
</p>
<pre>
    class Administrators::PeopleController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      defaults :route_prefix =&gt; 'admin'
    end
</pre>
<p>
Then your named routes will be: &#8216;admin_people_url&#8217;,
&#8216;admin_person_url&#8217; instead of
&#8216;administrators_people_url&#8217; and
&#8216;administrators_person_url&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
If you want to customize how resources are retrieved you can overwrite
collection and resource methods. The first is called on index action and
the second on all other actions. Let&#8217;s suppose you want to add
pagination to your projects collection:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      protected
        def collection
          @projects ||= end_of_association_chain.paginate(:page =&gt; params[:page])
        end
    end
</pre>
<p>
The end_of_association_chain returns your resource after nesting all
associations and scopes (more about this below).
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a> also
introduces another method called begin_of_association_chain. It&#8217;s
mostly used when you want to create resources based on the @current_user
and you have urls like &#8220;account/projects&#8220;. In such cases, you
have to do @current_user.projects.find or @current_user.projects.build in
your actions.
</p>
<p>
You can deal with it just doing:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      protected
        def begin_of_association_chain
          @current_user
        end
    end
</pre>
<h2>Overwriting actions</h2>
<p>
Let&#8217;s suppose that after destroying a project you want to redirect to
your root url instead of redirecting to projects url. You just have to do:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def destroy
        super do |format|
          format.html { redirect_to root_url }
        end
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
You are opening your action and giving the parent action a new behavior. On
the other hand, I have to agree that calling super is not very readable.
That&#8217;s why all methods have aliases. So this is equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def destroy
        destroy! do |format|
          format.html { redirect_to root_url }
        end
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Even more, since most of the times when you change a create, update or
destroy action is because you want to to change to where it redirects, a
shortcut is provided. So you can do:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def destroy
        destroy!{ root_url }
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
If you simply want to change the flash message for a particular action, you
can pass the message to the parent action using the keys :notice and :alert
(as you would with flash):
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def create
        create!(:notice =&gt; &quot;Dude! Nice job creating that project.&quot;)
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
You can still pass the block to change the redirect, as mentioned above:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def create
        create!(:notice =&gt; &quot;Dude! Nice job creating that project.&quot;) { root_url }
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Now let&#8217;s suppose that before create a project you have to do
something special but you don&#8217;t want to create a before filter for
it:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def create
        @project = Project.new(params[:project])
        @project.something_special!
        create!
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Yes, that simple! The nice part is since you already set the instance
variable @project, it will not build a project again.
</p>
<p>
Before we finish this topic, we should talk about one more thing:
&#8220;success/failure blocks&#8221;. Let&#8217;s suppose that when we
update our project, in case of failure, we want to redirect to the project
url instead of re-rendering the edit template.
</p>
<p>
Our first attempt to do this would be:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def update
        update! do |format|
          unless @project.errors.empty? # failure
            format.html { redirect_to project_url(@project) }
          end
        end
     end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Looks to verbose, right? We can actually do:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      def update
        update! do |success, failure|
          failure.html { redirect_to project_url(@project) }
        end
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Much better! So explaining everything: when you give a block which expects
one argument it will be executed in both scenarios: success and failure.
But If you give a block that expects two arguments, the first will be
executed only in success scenarios and the second in failure scenarios. You
keep everything clean and organized inside the same action.
</p>
<h2>Smart redirects</h2>
<p>
Although the syntax above is a nice shortcut, you won&#8217;t need to do it
frequently because (since version 1.2) Inherited Resources has smart
redirects. Redirects in actions calculates depending on the existent
controller methods.
</p>
<p>
Redirects in create and update actions calculates in following order
resource_url, collection_url, parent_url (which we are going to see later),
root_url. Redirect in destroy action calculate in following order
collection_url, parent_url, root_url.
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
    class ButtonsConntroller &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :window
      actions :all, :except =&gt; [:show, :index]
    end
</pre>
<p>
This controller redirect to parent window after all CUD actions.
</p>
<h2>Success and failure scenarios on destroy</h2>
<p>
The destroy action can also fail, this usually happens when you have a
before_destroy callback in your model which returns false. However, in
order to tell <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a> that it
really failed, you need to add errors to your model. So your before_destroy
callback on the model should be something like this:
</p>
<pre>
    def before_destroy
      if cant_be_destroyed?
        errors.add(:base, &quot;not allowed&quot;)
        false
      end
    end
</pre>
<h2>Belongs to</h2>
<p>
Finally, our Projects are going to get some Tasks. Then you create a
TasksController and do:
</p>
<pre>
    class TasksController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :project
    end
</pre>
<p>
belongs_to accepts several options to be able to configure the association.
For example, if you want urls like /projects/:project_title/tasks, you can
customize how <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a> find your
projects:
</p>
<pre>
    class TasksController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :project, :finder =&gt; :find_by_title!, :param =&gt; :project_title
    end
</pre>
<p>
It also accepts :route_name, :parent_class and :instance_name as options.
Check the <a
href="lib/inherited_resources/class_methods_rb.html">lib/inherited_resources/class_methods.rb</a>
for more.
</p>
<h2>Nested belongs to</h2>
<p>
Now, our Tasks get some Comments and you need to nest even deeper. Good
practices says that you should never nest more than two resources, but
sometimes you have to for security reasons. So this is an example of how
you can do it:
</p>
<pre>
    class CommentsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      nested_belongs_to :project, :task
    end
</pre>
<p>
If you need to configure any of these belongs to, you can nest them using
blocks:
</p>
<pre>
    class CommentsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :project, :finder =&gt; :find_by_title!, :param =&gt; :project_title do
        belongs_to :task
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Warning: calling several belongs_to is the same as nesting them:
</p>
<pre>
    class CommentsConroller &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :project
      belongs_to :task
    end
</pre>
<p>
In other words, the code above is the same as calling nested_belongs_to.
</p>
<h2>Polymorphic belongs to</h2>
<p>
We can go even further. Let&#8217;s suppose our Projects can now have
Files, Messages and Tasks, and they are all commentable. In this case, the
best solution is to use polymorphism:
</p>
<pre>
    class CommentsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :task, :file, :message, :polymorphic =&gt; true
      # polymorphic_belongs_to :task, :file, :message
    end
</pre>
<p>
You can even use it with nested resources:
</p>
<pre>
    class CommentsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :project do
        belongs_to :task, :file, :message, :polymorphic =&gt; true
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
The url in such cases can be:
</p>
<pre>
    /project/1/task/13/comments
    /project/1/file/11/comments
    /project/1/message/9/comments
</pre>
<p>
When using polymorphic associations, you get some free helpers:
</p>
<pre>
    parent?         #=&gt; true
    parent_type     #=&gt; :task
    parent_class    #=&gt; Task
    parent          #=&gt; @task
</pre>
<p>
Right now, Inherited Resources is limited and does not allow you to have
two polymorphic associations nested.
</p>
<h2>Optional belongs to</h2>
<p>
Later you decide to create a view to show all comments, independent if they
belong to a task, file or message. You can reuse your polymorphic
controller just doing:
</p>
<pre>
    class CommentsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :task, :file, :message, :optional =&gt; true
      # optional_belongs_to :task, :file, :message
    end
</pre>
<p>
This will handle all those urls properly:
</p>
<pre>
    /comment/1
    /tasks/2/comment/5
    /files/10/comment/3
    /messages/13/comment/11
</pre>
<p>
This is treated as a special type of polymorphic associations, thus all
helpers are available. As you expect, when no parent is found, the helpers
return:
</p>
<pre>
    parent?         #=&gt; false
    parent_type     #=&gt; nil
    parent_class    #=&gt; nil
    parent          #=&gt; nil
</pre>
<h2>Singletons</h2>
<p>
Now we are going to add manager to projects. We say that Manager is a
singleton resource because a Project has just one manager. You should
declare it as has_one (or resource) in your routes.
</p>
<p>
To declare an association as singleton, you just have to give the
:singleton option.
</p>
<pre>
    class ManagersController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      belongs_to :project, :singleton =&gt; true
      # singleton_belongs_to :project
    end
</pre>
<p>
It will deal with everything again and hide the action :index from you.
</p>
<h2>Namespaced Controllers</h2>
<p>
Namespaced controllers works out the box.
</p>
<pre>
    class Forum::PostsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
    end
</pre>
<p>
Inherited Resources prioritizes the default resource class for the
namespaced controller in this order:
</p>
<pre>
    Forum::Post
    ForumPost
    Post
</pre>
<h2>URL Helpers</h2>
<p>
When you use <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a> it creates
some URL helpers. And they handle everything for you. :)
</p>
<pre>
    # /posts/1/comments
    resource_url               # =&gt; /posts/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}
    resource_url(comment)      # =&gt; /posts/1/comments/#{comment.to_param}
    new_resource_url           # =&gt; /posts/1/comments/new
    edit_resource_url          # =&gt; /posts/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}/edit
    edit_resource_url(comment) #=&gt;  /posts/1/comments/#{comment.to_param}/edit
    collection_url             # =&gt; /posts/1/comments
    parent_url                 # =&gt; /posts/1

    # /projects/1/tasks
    resource_url               # =&gt; /projects/1/tasks/#{@task.to_param}
    resource_url(task)         # =&gt; /projects/1/tasks/#{task.to_param}
    new_resource_url           # =&gt; /projects/1/tasks/new
    edit_resource_url          # =&gt; /projects/1/tasks/#{@task.to_param}/edit
    edit_resource_url(task)    # =&gt; /projects/1/tasks/#{task.to_param}/edit
    collection_url             # =&gt; /projects/1/tasks
    parent_url                 # =&gt; /projects/1

    # /users
    resource_url               # =&gt; /users/#{@user.to_param}
    resource_url(user)         # =&gt; /users/#{user.to_param}
    new_resource_url           # =&gt; /users/new
    edit_resource_url          # =&gt; /users/#{@user.to_param}/edit
    edit_resource_url(user)    # =&gt; /users/#{user.to_param}/edit
    collection_url             # =&gt; /users
    parent_url                 # =&gt; /
</pre>
<p>
Those urls helpers also accepts a hash as options, just as in named routes.
</p>
<pre>
    # /projects/1/tasks
    collection_url(:page =&gt; 1, :limit =&gt; 10) #=&gt; /projects/1/tasks?page=1&amp;limit=10
</pre>
<p>
In polymorphic cases, you can also give the parent as parameter to
collection_url.
</p>
<p>
Another nice thing is that those urls are not guessed during runtime. They
are all created when your application is loaded (except for polymorphic
associations, that relies on <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
polymorphic_url).
</p>
<h2>Custom actions</h2>
<p>
Since version 1.2, Inherited Resources allows you to define custom actions
in controller:
</p>
<pre>
    class ButtonsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      custom_actions :resource =&gt; :delete, :collection =&gt; :search
    end
</pre>
<p>
This code creates delete and search actions in controller (they behaves
like show and index actions accordingly). Also, it will produce
delete_resource_{path,url} and search_resources_{path,url} url helpers.
</p>
<h2>What about views?</h2>
<p>
Sometimes just DRY the controllers is not enough, if you need to DRY up
your views, check this Wiki page:
</p>
<p>
<a
href="https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources/wiki/Views-Inheritance">github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources/wiki/Views-Inheritance</a>
</p>
<p>
Notice that <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 3.1 ships with view
inheritance built-in.
</p>
<h2>Some DSL</h2>
<p>
For those DSL lovers, <a
href="../classes/InheritedResources.html">InheritedResources</a>
won&#8217;t leave you alone. You can overwrite your success/failure blocks
straight from your class binding. For it, you just need to add a DSL module
to your application controller:
</p>
<pre>
    class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
      include InheritedResources::DSL
    end
</pre>
<p>
And then you can rewrite the last example as:
</p>
<pre>
    class ProjectsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
      update! do |success, failure|
        failure.html { redirect_to project_url(@project) }
