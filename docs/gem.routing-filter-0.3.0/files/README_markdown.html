# Routing Filter
</p>
<p>
Routing filters wrap around the complex beast that the Rails routing system
is to allow for unseen flexibility and power in Rails URL recognition and
generation.
</p>
<p>
As powerful and awesome the Rails&#8217; routes are, when you need to
design your URLs in a manner that only slightly leaves the paved cowpaths
of Rails conventions, you&#8217;re usually unable to use all the goodness
of helpers and convenience that Rails ships with.
</p>
<p>
This library comes with four more or less reusable filters and it is easy
to implement custom ones. Maybe the most popular one is the Locale routing
filter:
</p>
<ul>
<li>`Locale` - prepends the page&#8217;s :locale (e.g. /de/products)

</li>
<li>`Pagination` - appends page/:num (e.g. /products/page/2)

</li>
<li>`Uuid` - prepends a uuid for authentication or other purposes (e.g.
/d00fbbd1-82b6-4c1a-a57d-098d529d6854/products/1)

</li>
<li>`Extension` - appends an extension (e.g. /products.html)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please note that Rails 3&#8217;s routing system is much more powerful and
flexible than Rails 2 was. There are many usecases that now can be covered
with just Rails 3 default routing features that weren&#8217;t doable in
Rails 2. For an example of a quite complex and flexible route see this
[gist by Andrew White](<a
href="http://gist.github.com/653543">gist.github.com/653543</a>)
</p>
<p>
## Requirements
</p>
<p>
routing-filter currently only works with Rails. It should not be all too
hard to get it working with plain Rack::Mount but I haven&#8217;t had that
usecase, yet.
</p>
<p>
## Installation
</p>
<p>
Just install the Gem:
</p>
<pre>
    $ gem install routing-filter
</pre>
<p>
The Gem should work out of the box for Rails 3 after specifying it in your
application&#8217;s Gemfile.
</p>
<pre>
    # Gemfile
    gem 'routing-filter'
</pre>
<p>
In order to use it with Rails 2.x you could specify it in your
environment.rb
</p>
<pre>
    # config/environment.rb
    gem 'routing-filter'
</pre>
<p>
## Usage
</p>
<p>
Once the Gem has loaded you can setup the filters in your routes file like
this:
</p>
<pre>
    # in config/routes.rb
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      filter :pagination, :uuid
    end
</pre>
<p>
Filters can also accept options:
</p>
<pre>
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      filter :extension, :exclude =&gt; %r(^admin/)
    end
</pre>
<p>
## Running the tests
</p>
<p>
To run the tests against different dependencies [appraisal](<a
href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal">github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal</a>)
is used.
</p>
<p>
Running the tests for all supported Rails versions:
</p>
<pre>
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake all
</pre>
<p>
Running the tests for a single version, for example Rails 3.1:
</p>
<pre>
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake appraisal:rails-3.1 test
</pre>
<p>
Valid appraisal targets include rails-2.3, rails-3.0, rails-3.1 and
rails-3.2
</p>
<p>
## Filter order
</p>
<p>
You can picture the way routing-filter wraps filters around your
application as a russian puppet pattern. Your application sits in the
center and is wrapped by a number of filters. An incoming request&#8217;s
path will be past through these layers of filters from the outside in until
it is passed to the regular application routes set. When you generate URLs
on the other hand then the filters will be run from the inside out.
</p>
<p>
Filter order might be confusing at first. The reason for that is that the
way rack/mount (which is used by Rails as a core routing engine) is
confusing in this respect and Rails tries to make the best of it.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you have a filter :custom in your application routes.rb file and an
engine that adds a :common filter. Then Rails makes it so that your
application&#8217;s routes file will be loaded first (basically route.rb
files are loaded in reverse engine load order).
</p>
<p>
Thus routing-filter will make your :custom filter the <b>inner-most</b>
filter, wrapping the application <b>first</b>. The :common filter from your
engine will be wrapped <b>around</b> that onion and will be made the
<b>outer-most</b> filter.
</p>
<p>
This way common base filters (such as the locale filter) can run first and
do not need to know about the specifics of other (more specialized, custom)
filters. Custom filters on the other hand can easily take into account that
common filters might already have run and adjust accordingly.
</p>
<p>
## Implementing your own filters
</p>
<p>
For example implementations have a look at the existing filters in
[lib/routing_filter/filters](<a
href="http://github.com/svenfuchs/routing-filter/tree/master/lib/routing_filter/filters">github.com/svenfuchs/routing-filter/tree/master/lib/routing_filter/filters</a>)
</p>
<p>
The following would be a sceleton of an empty filter:
</p>
<pre>
    module RoutingFilter
      class Awesomeness &lt; Filter
        def around_recognize(path, env, &amp;block)
          # Alter the path here before it gets recognized.
          # Make sure to yield (calls the next around filter if present and
          # eventually `recognize_path` on the routeset):
          yield.tap do |params|
            # You can additionally modify the params here before they get passed
            # to the controller.
          end
        end

        def around_generate(params, &amp;block)
          # Alter arguments here before they are passed to `url_for`.
          # Make sure to yield (calls the next around filter if present and
          # eventually `url_for` on the controller):
          yield.tap do |result|
            # You can change the generated url_or_path here. Make sure to use
            # one of the &quot;in-place&quot; modifying String methods though (like sub!
            # and friends).
          end
        end
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
You can specify the filter explicitely in your routes.rb:
</p>
<pre>
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      filter :awesomeness
    end
</pre>
<p>
(I am not sure if it makes sense to provide more technical information than
this because the usage of this plugin definitely requires some advanced
knowledge about Rails internals and especially its routing system. So, I
figure, anyone who could use this should also be able to read the code and
figure out what it&#8217;s doing much better then from any lengthy
documentation.
</p>
<p>
If I&#8217;m mistaken on this please drop me an email with your
suggestions.)
</p>
<p>
## Rationale: Two example usecases
</p>
<p>
### Conditionally prepending the locale
</p>
<p>
An early usecase from which this originated was the need to define a locale
at the beginning of an URL in a way so that
</p>
<ul>
<li>the locale can be omitted when it is the default locale

</li>
<li>all the url_helpers that are generated by named routes as well as url_for
continue to work in

</li>
</ul>
<p>
a concise manner (i.e. without specifying all parameters again and again)
</p>
<ul>
<li>ideally also plays nicely with default route helpers in tests/specs

</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can read about this struggle and two possible, yet unsatisfying
solutions [here](<a
href="http://www.artweb-design.de/2007/5/13/concise-localized-rails-url-helpers-solved-twice">www.artweb-design.de/2007/5/13/concise-localized-rails-url-helpers-solved-twice</a>).
The conclusion so far is that Rails itself does not provide the tools to
solve this problem in a clean and dry way.
</p>
<p>
### Expanding /sections/:id to nested tree segments
</p>
<p>
Another usecase that eventually spawned the implementation of this plugin
was the need to map an arbitrary count of path segments to a certain model
instance. In an application that I&#8217;ve been working on recently I
needed to map URL paths to a nested tree of models like so:
</p>
<pre>
    root
    + docs
      + api
      + wiki
</pre>
<p>
E.g. the docs section should map to the path `/docs`, the api section to
the path `/docs/api` and so on. Furthermore, after these paths there need
to be more things to be specified. E.g. the wiki needs to define a whole
Rails resource with URLs like `/docs/wiki/pages/1/edit`.
</p>
<p>
The only way to solve this problem with Rails&#8217; routing toolkit is to
map a big, bold `/*everything` catch-all (&#8220;globbing&#8221;) route and
process the whole path in a custom dispatcher.
</p>
<p>
This, of course, is a really unsatisfying solution because one has to
reimplement everything that Rails routes are here to help with: regarding
both URL recognition (like parameter mappings, resources, &#8230;) and
generation (url_helpers).
</p>
<p>
## Solution
</p>
<p>
This plugin offers a solution that takes exactly the opposite route.
</p>
<p>
Instead of trying to change things <b>between</b> the URL recognition and
generation stages to achieve the desired result it *wraps around* the whole
routing system and allows to pre- and post-filter both what goes into it
(URL recognition) and what comes out of it (URL generation).
</p>
<p>
This way we can leave <b>everything</b> else completely untouched.
</p>
<ul>
<li>We can tinker with the URLs that we receive from the server and feed URLs
to

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rails that perfectly match the best breed of Rails&#8217; conventions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside of the application we can use all the nice helper goodness and

</li>
</ul>
<p>
conveniences that rely on these conventions being followed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally we can accept URLs that have been generated by the url_helpers and,

</li>
</ul>
<p>
again, mutate them in the way that matches our requirements.
</p>
<p>
So, even though the plugin itself is a blatant monkey-patch to one of the
most complex area of Rails internals, this solution seems to be effectively
less intrusive and pricey than others are.
