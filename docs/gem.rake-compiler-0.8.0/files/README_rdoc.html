        <h1>What is rake-compiler?</h1>
<p>
rake-compiler is first and foremost a productivity tool for Ruby
developers. It&#8217;s goal is to make the busy developer&#8217;s life
easier by simplifying the building and packaging of Ruby extensions by
simplifying code and reducing duplication.
</p>
<p>
It follows *convention over configuration* by advocating a standardized
build and package structure for both C and Java based RubyGems.
</p>
<p>
rake-compiler is the result of many hard-won experiences dealing with
several diverse RubyGems that provided native extensions for different
platforms and different user configurations in different ways. Details such
as differences in code portability, differences in code clarity, and
differences in project directory structure often made it very difficult for
newcomers to those RubyGems.
</p>
<p>
From these challenges, rake-compiler was born with the single-minded goal
of making the busy RubyGem developer&#8217;s life much less difficult.
</p>
<h2>Feature Overview</h2>
<p>
Some of the benefits rake-compiler provides include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No custom rake tasks required. Less code duplication and errors.

</li>
<li>Painlessly build extensions on different platforms (Linux, OSX and
Windows).

</li>
<li>Painlessly build extensions for different Ruby implementations (JRuby,
Rubinius and MRI).

</li>
<li>Allow multiple extensions to be compiled inside the same gem.

</li>
<li>Painlessly build &#8220;fat&#8221; native gems for Windows users (from
Linux or OSX).

</li>
<li>Mimics RubyGems standard installation process, helping as a test
environment.

</li>
<li>Simplifies cross platform extension compilation (targeting Windows from
Linux).

</li>
</ul>
<h2>OK, I&#8217;m sold! Show me how to install it!</h2>
<p>
Simple:
</p>
<pre>
  $ gem install rake-compiler
</pre>
<h2>That&#8217;s easy. How do I use it?</h2>
<p>
Now that you have installed rake-compiler, it&#8217;s time to give your
project a standardized structure.
</p>
<h3>Using a standardized project structure</h3>
<p>
Let&#8217;s say you want to compile an extension called
&#8216;hello_world&#8217;. Organizing your project&#8217;s code tree in the
following way will help rake-compiler do its job:
</p>
<pre>
    |-- ext
    |   `-- hello_world
    |       |-- extconf.rb
    |       |-- HelloWorldService.java
    |       `-- hello_world.c
    |-- lib
    `-- Rakefile
</pre>
<p>
TIP: Having a consistent project directory structure will help developers
and newcomers find and understand your code, making it easier for them to
contribute back to your project.
</p>
<h3>Adding the code to enable rake-compiler</h3>
<p>
Now the fun part. It&#8217;s time to introduce the code to your projects
Rakefile to tell it to use rake-compiler to build your extension:
</p>
<pre>
    # File: Rakefile

    require 'rake/extensiontask'

    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('hello_world')
</pre>
<p>
That&#8217;s it? Yes, that&#8217;s it! No other lines of code are needed
for rake-compiler to work its magic.
</p>
<p>
If you want to do the same for a JRuby extension written in Java,
it&#8217;s just as easy:
</p>
<pre>
    # File: Rakefile

    require 'rake/javaextensiontask'

    Rake::JavaExtensionTask.new('hello_world')
</pre>
<h3>The simple process</h3>
<p>
Those <b>two</b> simple lines of code automatically added the <a
href="../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> tasks needed to build your
&#8216;hello_world&#8217; extension. For example, checking the <a
href="../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> tasks on MRI Ruby 1.8.x/1.9 returns
something similar to:
</p>
<pre>
  $ rake -T
  (in /home/user/my_extension)
  rake compile                # Compile the extension(s)
  rake compile:hello_world    # Compile just the hello_world extension
</pre>
<p>
Simply calling <tt>compile</tt> like
</p>
<pre>
  $ rake compile
</pre>
<p>
performs the entire compile and build process for you and places the
resulting extension inside the <tt>lib</tt> directory of your project.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Please be aware that building C extensions requires the proper
development environment for your Platform, including libraries, headers and
build tools. Check your distro / vendor documentation on how to install
these development resources.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Building Java extensions requires the <tt>javac</tt>, part of the
Java Development Kit (JDK). This should be included by default on Mac OS X,
and downloadable from <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a> for
other operating systems.
</p>
<h3>Generating native RubyGems</h3>
<p>
A common usage scenario for rake-compiler is generating native gems that
bundle your extensions. As mentioned above, if you have your development
environment configured correctly, the following examples work even when
building native gems on Windows systems.
</p>
<p>
Creating native gems is really easy with rake-compiler&#8217;s
<tt>Rake::ExtensionTask</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    # somewhere in your Rakefile, define your gem spec
    spec = Gem::Specification.new do |s|
      s.name = &quot;my_gem&quot;
      s.platform = Gem::Platform::RUBY
      s.extensions = FileList[&quot;ext/**/extconf.rb&quot;]
    end

    # add your default gem packing task
    Gem::PackageTask.new(spec) do |pkg|
    end

    # feed the ExtensionTask with your spec
    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('hello_world', spec)
</pre>
<p>
As expected, you can still build your pure-ruby gem in the usual way
(standard output) by running:
</p>
<pre>
  $ rake gem
  (in /projects/oss/my_gem.git)
  mkdir -p pkg
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: my_gem
    Version: 0.1.0
    File: my_gem-0.1.0.gem
  mv my_gem-0.1.0.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0.gem
</pre>
<p>
Plus, rake-compiler tasks give you the extra functionality needed to build
native gems by running:
</p>
<pre>
  # rake native gem
  (... compilation output ...)
  mkdir -p pkg
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: my_gem
    Version: 0.1.0
    File: my_gem-0.1.0.gem
  mv my_gem-0.1.0.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0.gem
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: my_gem
    Version: 0.1.0
    File: my_gem-0.1.0-x86-mingw32.gem
  mv my_gem-0.1.0-x86-mingw32.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0-x86-mingw32.gem
</pre>
<p>
Did you notice that you get two gems for the price of one? How&#8217;s that
for a time saver?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, it&#8217;s just as easy to do the same thing for JRuby
extensions:
</p>
<pre>
  # rake java gem
  (... compilation output ...)
  mkdir -p pkg
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: my_gem
    Version: 0.1.0
    File: my_gem-0.1.0.gem
  mv my_gem-0.1.0.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0.gem
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: my_gem
    Version: 0.1.0
    File: my_gem-0.1.0-java.gem
  mv my_gem-0.1.0-java.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0-java.gem
</pre>
<h3>Great, but can I use a non-standard project structure?</h3>
<p>
Yes you can! While the conventional project structure is recommended, you
may want, or need, to tweak those conventions. Rake-compiler allows you to
customize several settings for <tt>Rake::ExtensionTask</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    Rake::ExtensionTask.new do |ext|
      ext.name = 'hello_world'                # indicate the name of the extension.
      ext.ext_dir = 'ext/weird_world'         # search for 'hello_world' inside it.
      ext.lib_dir = 'lib/my_lib'              # put binaries into this folder.
      ext.config_script = 'custom_extconf.rb' # use instead of the default 'extconf.rb'.
      ext.tmp_dir = 'tmp'                     # temporary folder used during compilation.
      ext.source_pattern = &quot;*.{c,cpp}&quot;        # monitor file changes to allow simple rebuild.
      ext.config_options &lt;&lt; '--with-foo'      # supply additional options to configure script.
      ext.gem_spec = spec                     # optionally indicate which gem specification
                                              # will be used.
    end
</pre>
<h2>Cross compilation - the future is now.</h2>
<p>
Rake-compiler also provides a standardized way to generate, from either
Linux or OSX, extensions and gem binaries for your Windows users!
</p>
<p>
How can this be you say? Simple, rake-compiler&#8217;s cross compilation
features take advantage of GCC&#8217;s host/target capabilities to build
&#8216;target&#8217; binaries on different &#8216;host&#8217; OS&#8217;s.
</p>
<h3>How I do this from Linux or OSX?</h3>
<p>
In addition to having the development tool chain installed (GCC), you also
need to install your platform&#8217;s <tt>mingw32</tt> cross compilation
package.
</p>
<p>
Installation depends upon your operating system/distribution. On Ubuntu and
Debian host machines, a simple <tt>apt-get install mingw32</tt> will be
enough.
</p>
<p>
On Arch, <tt>mingw32</tt> is installed by running <tt>pacman -S
mingw32-gcc</tt>
</p>
<p>
On OSX, we no longer recommend the usage of MacPorts <tt>mingw32</tt>
package because it stagnated in GCC version 3.4.5.
</p>
<p>
Instead we recommend you download mingw-w64 automated build packages
available at SourceForge:
</p>
<p>
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/downloads/mingw-w64">sourceforge.net/downloads/mingw-w64</a>/
</p>
<p>
Browse into <em>Toolchains targetting Win32</em> and then <em>Automated
Builds</em>.
</p>
<p>
Files will be ordered by recency, find the latest one with version 1.0 in
it, like this one:
</p>
<pre>
  mingw-w32-1.0-bin_i686-darwin_20110422.tar.bz2
</pre>
<p>
Download and extract. After that, make sure the bin directory is added to
the PATH, eg:
</p>
<pre>
  export PATH=~/mingw-w64/w32/bin:$PATH
</pre>
<p>
You can add this to your <tt>.profile</tt> to avoid the repitition.
</p>
<h3>I&#8217;ve got my tool-chain installed, now what?</h3>
<p>
First, you need to build Ruby for Windows on your Linux or OSX system.
</p>
<p>
Relax, no need to freak out! Let rake-compiler do all the heavy lifting for
you:
</p>
<pre>
  rake-compiler cross-ruby
</pre>
<p>
And you&#8217;re done. It will automatically download, configure and
compile the latest stable version of Ruby for Windows, and place it into
your <tt>~/.rake-compiler</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
This will create <tt>~/.rake-compiler/config.yml</tt> file so that
rake-compiler knows where to find the <tt>rbconfig.rb</tt> file that
matches the Ruby version on the Windows host system you&#8217;re
cross-compiling for. An example:
</p>
<pre>
  # File: ~/.rake-compiler/config.yml

  rbconfig-1.8.6: /path/to/ruby-1.8.6/rbconfig.rb
  rbconfig-1.8.7: /path/to/ruby-1.8.7/rbconfig.rb
  rbconfig-1.9.2: /path/to/ruby-1.9.2/rbconfig.rb
</pre>
<p>
If, instead, you want to build a different Ruby version than the default
one, please supply a <tt>VERSION</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
  rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.8.6-p114
</pre>
<p>
If you, like me, have multiple versions of MinGW packages installed, you
can specify the HOST that will be used to cross compile Ruby:
</p>
<pre>
  rake-compiler cross-ruby HOST=i386-mingw32 # (OSX mingw32 port)
</pre>
<p>
The host will vary depending on provider (mingw32 versus mingw-w64
projects). Please consult the documentation and website of the MinGW
package provider before reporting any issues.
</p>
<h3>OK, let&#8217;s cross compile some gems!</h3>
<p>
Now, you only need specify a few additional options in your extension
definition:
</p>
<pre>
    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension', gem_spec) do |ext|
      ext.cross_compile = true                # enable cross compilation (requires cross compile toolchain)
      ext.cross_platform = 'i386-mswin32'     # forces the Windows platform instead of the default one
                                              # configure options only for cross compile
      ext.cross_config_options &lt;&lt; '--with-something'

      # perform alterations on the gemspec when cross compiling
      ext.cross_compiling do |gem_spec|
        gem_spec.post_install_message = &quot;You installed the binary version of this gem!&quot;
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
By default, cross compilation targets &#8216;i386-mingw32&#8217; which is
the default GCC platform for Ruby.
</p>
<p>
To target gems for MRI Ruby&#8217;s current official distribution, please
force the platform to the one (i386-mswin32) previously shown.
</p>
<h3>Warning, magician about to do some tricks, don&#8217;t blink!</h3>
<p>
Cross compiling is still very simple:
</p>
<pre>
  rake cross compile
</pre>
<p>
And now, building gems for your Windows users is just 5 more letters:
</p>
<pre>
  rake cross native gem
</pre>
<p>
And you&#8217;re done, yeah.
</p>
<h3>But wait, there&#8217;s more</h3>
<p>
You can specify which version of Ruby to build the extension against:
</p>
<pre>
  rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8.6
</pre>
<p>
For example, if you installed <tt>1.9.2</tt>, you can do:
</p>
<pre>
  rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9.2
</pre>
<p>
Even better, you can target multiple versions (ie. 1.8.6 and 1.9.2) in the
same gem via:
</p>
<pre>
  rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8.6:1.9.2
</pre>
<p>
And better yet, you can bundle both binary extensions into one so-called
&#8220;fat&#8221; gem via:
</p>
<pre>
  rake cross native gem RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8.6:1.9.2
</pre>
<p>
That will place binaries for both the 1.8 and 1.9 versions of your Ruby
extensions inside your project&#8217;s <tt>lib_dir</tt> directory:
</p>
<pre>
  lib/1.8/my_extension.so
  lib/1.9/my_extension.so
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: building &#8220;fat&#8221; gems is currently only supported by
rake-compiler when cross compiling from a Linux or OSX host. Patches are
welcome if building &#8220;fat&#8221; gems from Windows hosts is desired,
or natively for your platform :-)
</p>
<p>
Now is up to you to make your gem load the proper binary at runtime:
</p>
<pre>
  begin
    RUBY_VERSION =~ /(\d+.\d+)/
    require &quot;#{$1}/my_extension&quot;
  rescue LoadError
    require &quot;my_extension&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
The above technique will lookup first for 1.8 or 1.9 version of the
extension and when not found, will look for the plain extension.
</p>
<p>
This approach catch the cases of provided fat binaries or gems compiled by
the end user installing the gem. It has also been implemented successfully
in several projects.
</p>
<h3>What are you talking about? (Give me examples)</h3>
<p>
I know all the above sounds like a complete foreign language (it does even
for me!). So, what if I show you some examples?
