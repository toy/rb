BUNDLE-PACKAGE(1) BUNDLE-PACKAGE(1)
</p>
<p>
NAME
</p>
<pre>
       bundle-package - Package your needed .gem files into your application
</pre>
<p>
SYNOPSIS
</p>
<pre>
       bundle package
</pre>
<p>
DESCRIPTION
</p>
<pre>
       Copy  all of the .gem files needed to run the application into the ven-
       dor/cache directory. In the future, when running bundle install(1) bun-
       dle-install.1.html, use the gems in the cache in preference to the ones
       on rubygems.org.
</pre>
<p>
GIT AND PATH GEMS
</p>
<pre>
       In Bundler 1.0, the bundle package command only  packages  .gem   files,
       not  gems  specified  using the :git or :path options. This will likely
       change in the future.
</pre>
<p>
REMOTE FETCHING
</p>
<pre>
       By default, if you simply run bundle  install(1)  bundle-install.1.html
       after  running  bundle  package(1)  bundle-package.1.html, bundler will
       still connect to rubygems.org to check whether a platform-specific  gem
       exists for any of the gems in vendor/cache.

       For instance, consider this Gemfile(5):

           source &quot;http://rubygems.org&quot;

           gem &quot;nokogiri&quot;

       If  you run bundle package under C Ruby, bundler will retrieve the ver-
       sion of nokogiri for the &quot;ruby&quot; platform. If you deploy  to  JRuby  and
       run  bundle install, bundler is forced to check to see whether a &quot;java&quot;
       platformed nokogiri exists.

       Even though the nokogiri gem  for  the  Ruby  platform  is  technically
       acceptable on JRuby, it actually has a C extension that does not run on
       JRuby. As  a  result,  bundler  will,  by  default,  still  connect  to
       rubygems.org to check whether it has a version of one of your gems more
       specific to your platform.

       This problem is also not just limited to the &quot;java&quot; platform. A similar
       (common) problem can happen when developing on Windows and deploying to
       Linux, or even when developing on OSX and deploying to Linux.

       If you know for sure that the gems packaged in vendor/cache are  appro-
       priate  for the platform you are on, you can run bundle install --local
       to skip checking for more appropriate gems, and just use  the  ones  in
       vendor/cache.

       One  way  to be sure that you have the right platformed versions of all
       your gems is to run bundle package on an identical machine and check in
       the  gems.  For  instance,  you   can run bundle package on an identical
       staging box during your staging process, and check in the  vendor/cache
       before deploying to production.
