&#8220;&#8221; &#8220;&#8221; . .SH &#8220;NAME&#8221; fBbundle-execfR -
Execute a command in the context of the bundle . .SH &#8220;SYNOPSIS&#8221;
fBbundle execfR fIcommandfR . .SH &#8220;DESCRIPTION&#8221; This command
executes the command, making all gems specified in the fBGemfile(5)fR
available to fBrequirefR in Ruby programs. . .P Essentially, if you would
normally have run something like fBrspec spec/my_spec\.rbfR, and you want
to use the gems specified in the fBGemfile(5)fR and installed via bundle
install(1) fIbundle-install.1.htmlfR, you should run fBbundle exec rspec
spec/my_spec\.rbfR. . .P Note that fBbundle execfR does not require that an
executable is available on your shell's fB$PATHfR. . .SH &#8220;BUNDLE
INSTALL -\-BINSTUBS&#8221; If you use the fB-\-binstubsfR flag in bundle
install(1) fIbundle-install.1.htmlfR, <a
href="../../../../classes/Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will automatically
create a directory (which defaults to fBapp_root/bin\fR) containing all of
the executables available from gems in the bundle. . .P After using
fB-\-binstubsfR, fBbin/rspec spec/my_spec\.rbfR is identical to fBbundle
exec rspec spec/my_spec\.rbfR. . .SH &#8220;ENVIRONMENT
MODIFICATIONS&#8221; fBbundle execfR makes a number of changes to the shell
environment, then executes the command you specify in full. . .IP
&#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 make sure that it's still possible to shell out to
fBbundlefR from inside a command invoked by fBbundle execfR (using
fB$BUNDLE_BIN_PATH\fR) . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 put the directory
containing executables (like fBrailsfR, fBrspecfR, fBrackupfR) for your
bundle on fB$PATHfR . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 make sure that if bundler is
invoked in the subshell, it uses the same fBGemfilefR (by setting
fBBUNDLE_GEMFILE\fR) . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 add fB-rbundler/setup\fR to
fB$RUBYOPTfR, which makes sure that Ruby programs invoked in the subshell
can see the gems in the bundle . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 0 . .P It also modifies
Rubygems: . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 disallow loading additional gems not in
the bundle . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 modify the fBgemfR method to be a
no-op if a gem matching the requirements is in the bundle, and to raise a
fBGem::LoadErrorfR if it's not . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 Define
fBGem.refreshfR to be a no-op, since the source index is always frozen when
using bundler, and to prevent gems from the system leaking into the
environment . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221; 4 Override fBGem.bin_path\fR to use the
gems in the bundle, making system executables work . .IP &#8220;(bu&#8221;
4 Add all gems in the bundle into Gem.loaded_specs . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 0 .
.SS &#8220;Shelling out&#8221; When shelling out (using the fBsystemfR or
backticks methods, for example), Bundler's environment changes will
propogate to the subshell environment. If you desire to shell out without
Bundler's environment changes, simply employ the fBwith_clean_env\fR
method. It will restore all environment variables to what they were before
<a href="../../../../classes/Bundler.html">Bundler</a> was activated. For
example: . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 4 . .nf
</p>
<p>
Bundler.with_clean_env do
</p>
<pre>
  `brew install wget`
</pre>
<p>
end . .fi . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 0 . .SH &#8220;RUBYGEMS PLUGINS&#8221; At
present, the Rubygems plugin system requires all files named
fBrubygems_plugin\.rbfR on the load path of fIanyfR installed gem when any
Ruby code requires fBrubygems.rbfR. This includes executables installed
into the system, like fBrailsfR, fBrackupfR, and fBrspecfR. . .P Since
Rubygems plugins can contain arbitrary Ruby code, they commonly end up
activating themselves or their dependencies. . .P For instance, the
fBgemcutter 0.5fR gem depended on fBjson_pure\fR. If you had that version
of gemcutter installed (even if you fIalsofR had a newer version without
this problem), Rubygems would activate fBgemcutter 0.5fR and fBjson_pure
<latest>fR. . .P If your Gemfile(5) also contained fBjson_pure\fR (or a gem
with a dependency on fBjson_pure\fR), the latest version on your system
might conflict with the version in your Gemfile(5), or the snapshot version
in your fBGemfile.lockfR. . .P If this happens, bundler will say: . .IP
&#8220;&#8221; 4 . .nf
</p>
<p>
You have already activated json_pure 1.4.6 but your Gemfile requires
json_pure 1.4.3. Consider using bundle exec. . .fi . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 0 .
.P In this situation, you almost certainly want to remove the underlying
gem with the problematic gem plugin. In general, the authors of these
plugins (in this case, the fBgemcutterfR gem) have released newer versions
that are more careful in their plugins. . .P You can find a list of all the
gems containing gem plugins by running . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 4 . .nf
</p>
<p>
ruby -rubygems -e &#8220;puts Gem.find_files('rubygems_plugin\.rb')&#8221;
. .fi . .IP &#8220;&#8221; 0 . .P At the very least, you should remove all
but the newest version of each gem plugin, and also remove all gem plugins
that you aren't using (fBgem uninstall gem_name\fR).
