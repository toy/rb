BUNDLE-CONFIG(1) BUNDLE-CONFIG(1)
</p>
<p>
NAME
</p>
<pre>
       bundle-config - Set bundler configuration options
</pre>
<p>
SYNOPSIS
</p>
<pre>
       bundle config [name [value]]
</pre>
<p>
DESCRIPTION
</p>
<pre>
       This  command  allows you to interact with bundler's configuration sys-
       tem. Bundler retrieves its configuration  from  the  local  application
       (app/.bundle/config), environment variables, and the user's home direc-
       tory (~/.bundle/config), in that order of priority.

       Executing bundle config with no parameters will print  a  list  of  all
       bundler configuration for the current bundle, and where that configura-
       tion was set.

       Executing bundle config &lt;name&gt; will print the value of that  configura-
       tion setting, and where it was set.

       Executing  bundle  config &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt; will set that configuration to
       the value specified for all bundles executed as the current  user.  The
       configuration will be stored in ~/.bundle/config.
</pre>
<p>
BUILD OPTIONS
</p>
<pre>
       You  can use bundle config to give bundler the flags to pass to the gem
       installer every time bundler tries to install a particular gem.

       A very common example, the mysql gem, requires Snow  Leopard  users  to
       pass  configuration  flags  to gem install to specify where to find the
       mysql_config executable.

           gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config

       Since the specific location of that executable can change from  machine
       to machine, you can specify these flags on a per-machine basis.

           bundle config build.mysql --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config

       After  running  this  command,  every time bundler needs to install the
       mysql gem, it will pass along the flags you specified.
</pre>
<p>
CONFIGURATION KEYS
</p>
<pre>
       Configuration keys in bundler have two forms: the  canonical  form  and
       the environment variable form.

       For  instance,  passing  the  --without   flag to bundle install(1) bun-
       dle-install.1.html prevents  Bundler  from  installing  certain  groups
       specified  in  the Gemfile(5). Bundler persists this value in app/.bun-
       dle/config so that calls to Bundler.setup do not try to find gems  from
       the  Gemfile that you didn't install. Additionally, subsequent calls to
       bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html remember this setting and  skip
       those groups.

       The  canonical  form of this configuration is &quot;without&quot;. To convert the
       canonical form to the environment variable  form,  capitalize  it,  and
       prepend  BUNDLE_.  The  environment  variable form of &quot;without&quot; is BUN-
       DLE_WITHOUT.

LIST OF AVAILABLE KEYS
</p>
<pre>
       The following is a list of all configuration keys  and  their  purpose.
       You  can  learn  more  about  their operation in bundle install(1) bun-
       dle-install.1.html.

       path (BUNDLE_PATH)
              The location on disk to install gems. Defaults to  $GEM_HOME  in
              development and vendor/bundler when --deployment is used

       frozen (BUNDLE_FROZEN)
              Disallow changes to the Gemfile. Defaults to true when --deploy-
              ment is used.

       without (BUNDLE_WITHOUT)
              A :-separated list of  groups  whose  gems  bundler  should  not
              install

       bin (BUNDLE_BIN)
              Install  executables  from  gems in the bundle to the specified
              directory. Defaults to false.

       gemfile (BUNDLE_GEMFILE)
              The name of the file that bundler should use  as  the  Gemfile.
              This  location  of  this file also sets the root of the project,
              which is used to resolve relative paths in  the  Gemfile,  among
              other  things.  By default, bundler will search up from the cur-
              rent working directory until it finds a Gemfile.

       In general, you should set these settings per-application by using  the
       applicable flag to the bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html command.

       You can set them globally either via environment  variables  or  bundle
       config,  whichever is preferable for your setup. If you use both, envi-
       ronment variables will take preference over global settings.
