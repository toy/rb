<li>What you can do

</li>
</ol>
<p>
This extension module defines a module named <a
href="../../../classes/PTY.html">PTY</a>, which contains following module
fungtions:
</p>
<pre>
   getpty(command)
   spawn(command)

      This function reserves a pty, executes command over the pty
      and returns an array. The return value is an array with three
      elements. The first element in the array is for reading and the
      second for writing. The third element is the process ID of the
      child process. If this function is called with an iterator block,
      the array is passed to the block as block parameters, and the
      function itself returns nil.

      When the child process is suspended or finished, an exception is
      raised.  If this function is called with an iterator block,
      exception is raised only within the block.  Child process
      monitor is terminated on block exit.

   protect_signal
   reset_signal

      These functions are obsolete in this version of pty.
