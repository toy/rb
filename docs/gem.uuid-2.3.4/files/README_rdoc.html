        <h1><a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> Generator</h1>
<p>
Generates universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for use in distributed
applications. Based on <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">RFC
4122</a>.
</p>
<h2>Generating UUIDs</h2>
<p>
Call generate to generate a new <a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a>.
The method returns a string in one of three formats. The default format is
36 characters long, and contains the 32 hexadecimal octets and hyphens
separating the various value parts. The <tt>:compact</tt> format omits the
hyphens, while the <tt>:urn</tt> format adds the <tt>:urn:uuid</tt> prefix.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
  uuid = UUID.new
  10.times do
    p uuid.generate
  end
</pre>
<h2>UUIDs in Brief</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> (universally unique identifier) are
guaranteed to be unique across time and space.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> is 128 bit long, and consists of
a 60-bit time value, a 16-bit sequence number and a 48-bit node identifier.
</p>
<p>
The time value is taken from the system clock, and is monotonically
incrementing. However, since it is possible to set the system clock
backward, a sequence number is added. The sequence number is incremented
each time the <a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> generator is started.
The combination guarantees that identifiers created on the same machine are
unique with a high degree of probability.
</p>
<p>
Note that due to the structure of the <a
href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> and the use of sequence number, there
is no guarantee that <a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> values
themselves are monotonically incrementing. The <a
href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> value cannot itself be used to sort
based on order of creation.
</p>
<p>
To guarantee that UUIDs are unique across all machines in the network, the
IEEE 802 MAC address of the machine&#8217;s network interface card is used
as the node identifier.
</p>
<p>
For more information see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">RFC
4122</a>.
</p>
<h2><a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> State File</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> generator uses a state file to
hold the MAC address and sequence number.
</p>
<p>
The MAC address is used to generate identifiers that are unique to your
machine, preventing conflicts in distributed applications. The MAC address
is six bytes (48 bit) long. It is automatically extracted from one of the
network cards on your machine.
</p>
<p>
The sequence number is incremented each time the <a
href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> generator is first used by the
application, to prevent multiple processes from generating the same set of
identifiers, and deal with changes to the system clock.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> state file is created in
<tt>/var/tmp/ruby-uuid</tt> or the Windows common application data
directory using mode 0644. If that directory is not writable, the file is
created as <tt>.ruby-uuid</tt> in the home directory. If you need to create
the file with a different mode, use <a
href="../classes/UUID.html#M000004">UUID#state_file</a> before running the
<a href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> generator.
</p>
<p>
Note: If you are running on a shared host where the state file is not
shared between processes, or persisted across restarts (e.g. Heroku, Google
App Engine) you can simple turn it off:
</p>
<pre>
  UUID.state_file = false
</pre>
<p>
State files are not portable across machines.
</p>
<p>
Note: when using a forking server (Unicorn, Resque, Pipemaster, etc) you
don&#8217;t want your forked processes using the same sequence number. Make
sure to increment the sequence number each time a worker forks.
</p>
<p>
For example, in config/unicorn.rb:
</p>
<pre>
  after_fork do |server, worker|
    UUID.generator.next_sequence
  end
</pre>
<h2>Command Line</h2>
<p>
You can run uuid from the command line, generating new <a
href="../classes/UUID.html">UUID</a> to stdout:
</p>
<pre>
  $ uuid
</pre>
<p>
Multiple UUIDs in a sequence, separated with a newline:
</p>
<pre>
  $ uuid --count 10
</pre>
<p>
You can also run client and server from the command line
</p>
<pre>
  $ uuid --server &amp;
  $ uuid --socket /var/lib/uuid.sock
</pre>
