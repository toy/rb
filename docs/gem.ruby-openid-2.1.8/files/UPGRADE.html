        <h1>Upgrading from the <a href="../classes/OpenID.html">OpenID</a> 1.x series library</h1>
<h2>Consumer Upgrade</h2>
<p>
The flow is largely the same, however there are a number of significant
changes. The consumer example is helpful to look at:
examples/rails_openid/app/controllers/consumer_controller.rb
</p>
<h3>Stores</h3>
<p>
You will need to require the file for the store that you are using. For the
filesystem store, this is &#8216;openid/stores/filesystem&#8217; They are
also now in modules. The filesystem store is
</p>
<pre>
  OpenID::Store::Filesystem
</pre>
<p>
The format has changed, and you should remove your old store directory.
</p>
<p>
The ActiveRecord store ( examples/active_record_openid_store ) still needs
to be put in a plugin directory for your rails app. There&#8217;s a
migration that needs to be run; examine the <a
href="README.html">README</a> in that directory.
</p>
<p>
Also, note that the stores now can be garbage collected with the method
</p>
<pre>
  store.cleanup
</pre>
<h3>Starting the <a href="../classes/OpenID.html">OpenID</a> transaction</h3>
<p>
The OpenIDRequest object no longer has status codes. Instead,
consumer.begin raises an <a
href="../classes/OpenID/OpenIDError.html">OpenID::OpenIDError</a> if there
is a problem initiating the transaction, so you&#8217;ll want something
along the lines of:
</p>
<pre>
  begin
    openid_request = consumer.begin(params[:openid_identifier])
  rescue OpenID::OpenIDError =&gt; e
    # display error e
    return
  end
  #success case
</pre>
<p>
Data regarding the <a href="../classes/OpenID.html">OpenID</a> server once
lived in
</p>
<pre>
  openid_request.service
</pre>
<p>
The corresponding object in the 2.0 lib can be retrieved with
</p>
<pre>
  openid_request.endpoint
</pre>
<p>
Getting the unverified identifier: Where you once had
</p>
<pre>
  openid_request.identity_url
</pre>
<p>
you will now want
</p>
<pre>
  openid_request.endpoint.claimed_id
</pre>
<p>
which might be different from what you get at the end of the transaction,
since it is now possible for users to enter their server&#8217;s url
directly.
</p>
<p>
Arguments on the return_to URL are now verified, so if you want to add
additional arguments to the return_to url, use
</p>
<pre>
  openid_request.return_to_args['param'] = value
</pre>
<p>
Generating the redirect is the same as before, but add any extensions
first.
</p>
<p>
If you need to set up an SSL certificate authority list for the fetcher,
use the &#8216;ca_file&#8217; attr_accessor on the <a
href="../classes/OpenID/StandardFetcher.html">OpenID::StandardFetcher</a>.
This has changed from &#8216;ca_path&#8217; in the 1.x.x series library.
That is, set <a
href="../classes/OpenID.html#M000270">OpenID.fetcher</a>.ca_file =
&#8216;/path/to/ca.list&#8217; before calling consumer.begin.
</p>
<h3>Requesting Simple Registration Data</h3>
<p>
You&#8217;ll need to require the code for the extension
</p>
<pre>
  require 'openid/extensions/sreg'
</pre>
<p>
The new code for adding an SReg request now looks like:
</p>
<pre>
  sreg_request = OpenID::SReg::Request.new
  sreg_request.request_fields(['email', 'dob'], true) # required
  sreg_request.request_fields(['nickname', 'fullname'], false) # optional
  sreg_request.policy_url = policy_url
  openid_request.add_extension(sreg_request)
</pre>
<p>
The code for adding other extensions is similar. Code for the Attribute
Exchange (AX) and Provider Authentication Policy Extension (PAPE) are
included with the library, and additional extensions can be implemented
subclassing <a
href="../classes/OpenID/Extension.html">OpenID::Extension</a>.
</p>
<h3>Completing the transaction</h3>
<p>
The return_to and its arguments are verified, so you need to pass in the
base URL and the arguments. With Rails, the params method mashes together
parameters from GET, POST, and the path, so you&#8217;ll need to pull off
the path &#8220;parameters&#8221; with something like
</p>
<pre>
  return_to = url_for(:only_path =&gt; false,
                      :controller =&gt; 'openid',
                      :action =&gt; 'complete')
  parameters = params.reject{|k,v| request.path_parameters[k] }
  openid_response = consumer.complete(parameters, return_to)
</pre>
<p>
The response still uses the status codes, but they are now namespaced
slightly differently, for example OpenID::Consumer::SUCCESS
</p>
<p>
In the case of failure, the error message is now found in
</p>
<pre>
  openid_response.message
</pre>
<p>
The identifier to display to the user can be found in
</p>
<pre>
  openid_response.endpoint.display_identifier
</pre>
<p>
The Simple Registration response can be read from the <a
href="../classes/OpenID.html">OpenID</a> response with
</p>
<pre>
  sreg_response = OpenID::SReg::Response.from_success_response(openid_response)
  nickname = sreg_response['nickname']
  # etc.
</pre>
<h2>Server Upgrade</h2>
<p>
The server code is mostly the same as before, with the exception of
extensions. Also, you must pass in the endpoint URL to the server
constructor:
</p>
<pre>
  @server = OpenID::Server.new(store, server_url)
</pre>
<p>
I recommend looking at
examples/rails_openid/app/controllers/server_controller.rb for an example
of the new way of doing extensions.
