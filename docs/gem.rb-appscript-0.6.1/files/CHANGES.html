2010-03-19 &#8212; 0.6.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>removed 32-bit only AE.run_application_event_loop,
AE.quit_application_event_loop

</li>
<li>updated AE.launch_application to use LSOpenApplication

</li>
<li>minor documentation fixes

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2010-12-17 &#8212; 0.6.0
</p>
<ul>
<li>added UTF-8 Encoding support in Ruby 1.9+; added
AEMCodecs::Codecs#use_ascii_8bit for optionally disabling it

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Codecs.html#M000048">AEM::Codecs#pack</a> now accepts
Date, DateTime instances; added AEM::Codecs#use_date_time method for
unpacking typeLongDateTime descriptors as DateTime instead of Time
instances

</li>
<li>removed AE.get_app_terminology() as it relied on deprecated Carbon APIs

</li>
<li>added AE.copy_scripting_definition()

</li>
<li>the <a href="../classes/OSAX.html">OSAX</a> module now now uses
OSACopyScriptingDefinition() to obtain scripting addition terminology, so
works in both 32- and 64-bit Ruby. Note that in addition to limitations of
OSACopyScriptingDefinition (e.g. aete-to-sdef conversion is not 100%
reliable), the SdefParser is limited in capability (no support for
xi:include, class-extension, synonym elements), but should suffice for
parsing relatively simple osax dictionaries.

</li>
<li>modified <a
href="../classes/Terminology.html#M000320">Terminology.dump()</a> to
retrieve aete resources via &#8216;ascrgdte&#8217; events; added <a
href="../classes/OSAX.html#M000456">OSAX.dump()</a> method

</li>
<li>added workaround for transaction id bug in some versions of OS X 10.6

</li>
<li>renamed AEMReference::Base class to <a
href="../classes/AEMReference/Query.html">AEMReference::Query</a>

</li>
<li>renamed Send::CommandError class to <a
href="../classes/Send/EventError.html">Send::EventError</a>; note that <a
href="../classes/AEM.html">AEM</a> re-exports it as AEM::EventError and
[for backwards compatibilty] AEM::CommandError

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2009-07-18 &#8212; 0.5.3
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed pALL code in defaultterminology

</li>
<li>fixed <a href="../classes/OSAX.html">OSAX</a> module initialisation code
(previously didn&#8217;t initialise if ScriptingAddition.new was called
directly)

</li>
<li>fixed out-of-date URLs in appscript manual

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2009-07-05 &#8212; 0.5.2
</p>
<ul>
<li>removed deprecated AEM::Application.is_running? method

</li>
<li>added dont_cache_unpacked_specifiers, pack_strings_as_type compatibility
options to <a href="../classes/Codecs.html">AEM::Codecs</a>

</li>
<li>added default definitions for &#8216;item&#8217; type, &#8216;items&#8217;
elements, &#8216;properties&#8217; property as Apple have removed the
&#8216;item&#8217; class definition from skeleton.sdef (the default
terminology for Cocoa apps)

</li>
<li>property and elements methods now raise ArgumentError if passed arguments;
previously, malformed elements selectors, e.g.
app(&#8216;TextEdit&#8217;).documents(1).text, would be silently ignored,
resulting in unexpected behaviour

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Codecs.html#M000075">Codecs#unpack</a> now tries to
coerce descriptors of typeVersion to unicode text (works on 10.4+) c.f.
AppleScript (note: itunes.version.get returns the wrong version number
otherwise; this appears to be an iTunes bug, but is masked by current
AppleScript behaviour)

</li>
<li>process_exists_for_url?, remote_app in connect.rb now raise error if URL
string doesn&#8217;t contain a colon (process will crash otherwise due to
an OS bug)

</li>
<li>improved error reporting in Reference#[] when a malformed generic reference
containing a command expands to a non-reference value. e.g. its.name.get()
would previously expand the the value of the object&#8217;s
&#8216;name&#8217; property, typically a string, resulting in a cryptic
NoMethodError; this now raises a descriptive ArgumentError.

</li>
<li>fixed bug where <a href="../classes/Terminology.html">Terminology</a>
module would error on zero-length keywords in problem dictionaries (e.g. MS
Word 12.1.7)

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Codecs.html">AEM::Codecs</a> now correctly unpacks
AEDescs of typeBoolean whose data >1 byte

</li>
<li>fixed inconsistent escaping of application-defined property/element names
that overlap built-in type/enum/property names but uses different codes.
e.g. Adobe Illustrator defines &#8216;rotation&#8217; as &#8216;SxRx&#8217;
- this overlaps built-in definition (&#8216;rotation&#8217; =
&#8216;trot&#8217;), so is escaped as &#8216;rotation_&#8217;. Previously
only the Keyword was escaped (i.e. :rotation_ but ref.rotation) now both
are escaped (i.e. :rotation_, ref.rotation_). Users should update existing
code as needed.

</li>
<li>restructured defaultterminology.rb to make it easier to maintain

</li>
<li>changed default terminology mapping for :data from KAE::CRawData
(&#8216;rdat&#8217;) to KAE::TypeData (&#8216;tdta&#8217;)

</li>
<li>the <a href="../classes/OSAX.html">OSAX</a> module now obtains list of
installed scripting additions on first use instead of import (the .osax
scanning code uses System Events via <a href="../classes/AEM.html">AEM</a>,
and sending Apple events in event loop-based application before the event
loop is started can disrupt the process&#8217;s handling of incoming Apple
events)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2008-02-18 &#8212; 0.5.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Application.html#M000407">Appscript::Application#launch</a>
where calling it on an application specified by_pid/by_url/by_aem_app would
raise error -1708

</li>
<li>aem by-range specifiers now accept non-reference values (these are expanded
to con-based references when packed)

</li>
<li>fixed bug in <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Reference.html#M000350">Appscript::Reference#_send_command</a>
method&#8217;s auto-reconnection code where a re-sent event that fails now
raises the correct CommandError (previously re-raised the original
&#8216;invalid connection&#8217; error)

</li>
<li>fixed bug when packing Fixnums in 64-bit Ruby

</li>
<li>fixed a memory leak in AE.get_app_terminology

</li>
<li>fixed minor bug and improved error reporting in Appscript::Reference#[]

</li>
<li>removed AEMReference::PositionSpecifier&#8217;s and, or, not methods as
these shortcuts are no longer supported

</li>
<li>basic Ruby 1.9 compatibility

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2007-12-18 &#8212; 0.5.0 (beta 2)
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/OSAX.html">OSAX</a> module no longer errors on import
in 10.5 if a ScriptingAdditions folder (e.g. ~/Library/ScriptingAdditions)
doesn&#8217;t exist

</li>
<li>added Appscript::Application#is_running? method

</li>
<li>added hfs_path, hfs_path methods to <a
href="../classes/MacTypes/Alias.html">MacTypes::Alias</a>, <a
href="../classes/MacTypes/FileURL.html">MacTypes::FileURL</a>; existing
path, path methods now use CFURL functions to convert between POSIX paths
and URLs

</li>
<li>aem/appscript now raises <a
href="../classes/Connect/CantLaunchApplicationError.html">Connect::CantLaunchApplicationError</a>
instead of AE::MacOSError if unable to launch an application. Users should
update existing code as necessary.

</li>
<li>fixed extconf.rb so that universal binaries build correctly

</li>
<li>built-in help system now uses ASDictionary 0.9.0+ instead of
AppscriptHelpAgent. (AppscriptHelpAgent is no longer used as-of
rb-appscript 0.5.0 and may be removed if previously installed.)

</li>
<li>help method now writes messages to stderr instead of stdout

</li>
<li><a
href="../classes/Appscript/Reference.html#M000351">Appscript::Reference#respond_to?</a>
now has identical signature to Object#respond_to? (optional second argument
was previously missing)

</li>
<li>fixed bug in AE.convert_long_date_time_to_unix_seconds (used to unpack
AEDescs of typeLongDateTime) where it would crash if passed a FixNum
instead of a BigNum

</li>
<li>now allow methods that have been added to Object class at runtime (e.g.
importing the &#8216;pp&#8217; module adds pretty_print and pretty_inspect)
to be invoked on <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Reference.html">Appscript::Reference</a> and <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Application.html">Appscript::Application</a>
instances, assuming that the reference object doesn&#8217;t already have a
property/element/command by the same name. In other words, instances of
these classes now behave more or less the same as instances of ordinary
subclasses that use bound methods rather than method_missing to handle
incoming messages. Previously, calling (e.g.) pretty_inspect on an
appscript reference would result in a &#8216;property/element/command not
found&#8217; error.

</li>
<li>improved behaviour of <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Application.html#M000403">Appscript::Application#AS_new_reference</a>
when argument is nil (now returns a new reference to the root application
object)

</li>
<li>OSAX::Application initialiser now optionally accepts static terminology
&#8216;glue&#8217; module as its second argument. This is partly to provide
scripts that need to run in 64-bit processes with a workaround for
accessing the <a href="../classes/OSAX.html">OSAX</a> module, which
can&#8217;t yet automatically obtain osax terminology under 64-bit (see
TODO file).

</li>
<li>added process_exists_for_path?, process_exists_for_pid?,
process_exists_for_url?, process_exists_for_desc? class methods to <a
href="../classes/AEM/Application.html">AEM::Application</a>

</li>
<li>deprecated AEM::Application.is_running? (will be removed in 1.0.0); any
existing code that uses this method should be updated to use <a
href="../classes/AEM/Application.html#M000279">AEM::Application.process_exists_for_path?</a>
instead

</li>
<li>fixed minor formatting flaw in generic references&#8217; to_s method

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/AEM/Application.html">AEM::Application</a> is now a
subclass of AEMReference::Base, allowing aem <a
href="../classes/Codecs.html">Codecs</a> instances to pack it

</li>
<li>added AB_export_vcard.rb sample script

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2007-08-17 &#8212; 0.4.0 (beta 1)
</p>
<ul>
<li>renamed the following aem/appscript methods to be consistent with
AppleScript:

<pre>
      start -&gt; beginning
      starts_with -&gt; begins_with
      does_not_start_with -&gt; does_not_begin_with
      start_transaction -&gt; begin_transaction
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Users should update existing code as necessary.
</p>
<ul>
<li>aem and appscript no longer accept non-test references as test clauses.
Previously, a reference such as &#8216;its.visible&#8217; would
automatically be expanded to the comparison test
&#8216;its.visible.eq(true)&#8217; as a convenience. However, this shortcut
didn&#8217;t apply when these non-test references appeared as arguments to
the and and or logical test methods, which meant that this shortcut
behaviour was inconsistent and potentially confusing; therefore it has been
removed. Users should update existing code as necessary.

</li>
<li>added AE::AEDesc#send_thread_safe; this is now used by <a
href="../classes/AEM.html">AEM</a> instead of AE::AEDesc.send to allow
reply events to be received on non-main threads (note: this is a non-issue
in non-threaded processes or in processes that only use Ruby 1.x&#8217;s
green threads within the main native thread, but as the additional overhead
isn&#8217;t noticeable it does no harm to make it the default behaviour
anyway).

</li>
<li>added AE::AEDesc#flatten and AE::AEDesc.unflatten for serialising AEDescs

</li>
<li>added support for custom reference roots in <a
href="../classes/AEM.html">AEM</a> and <a
href="../classes/Appscript.html">Appscript</a>

</li>
<li><a
href="../classes/AEM/Application.html#M000289">AEM::Application#inspect</a>
now displays correct class name when Application class is subclassed

</li>
<li>Appscript::Reference#[] now accepts real references and aem specifiers as
by-filter test clauses (previously only accepted GenericReference)

</li>
<li>added note about rubygems to appscript manual; added rubygems support to
sample scripts

</li>
<li>aete parser no longer raises error if aete isn&#8217;t fully parsed (i.e.
same as AppleScript) [SI]

</li>
<li>added <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Reference.html#M000348">Appscript::Reference#help</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2007-04-10 &#8212; 0.3.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit support in rbae.c [JB]

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Terminology.html#M000320">Terminology.dump</a> will use
&#8216;ascrgdte&#8217; event to obtain aetes if AE.get_app_terminology is
unavailable

</li>
<li>added TypeUInt16, TypeUInt64 support to <a
href="../classes/Codecs.html#M000075">Codecs#unpack</a>

</li>
<li>added Codecs#pack_uint16; by default, this packs numbers in range
(2**63)..(2**64 - 1) as 64-bit floats (lossy), but clients could override
this to pack as TypeUInt64 where supported by OS and applications

</li>
<li>changed timeout for ascrgdte event to 120 sec

</li>
<li>terminology parser no longer errors on zero-length aetes

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2007-01-18 &#8212; 0.3.0
</p>
<ul>
<li>removed &#8216;AS&#8217; alias; client scripts should refer to <a
href="../classes/Appscript.html">Appscript</a> module, e.g.:

<pre>
      textedit = AS.app('TextEdit')
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
should be changed to:
</p>
<pre>
        textedit = Appscript.app('TextEdit')
</pre>
<ul>
<li>added &#8216;p&#8217; prefixes to &#8216;pcls&#8217; and &#8216;ID &#8217;
keys in DefaultTerminology::ReferenceByCode (minor bugfix)

</li>
<li>in AE::AEDesc, renamed get to get_item and added get_param and get_attr
methods

</li>
<li>improved unpacking of object specifiers and other reference-related AEDescs
(10-20% faster)

</li>
<li>adjusted ordering of case blocks in <a
href="../classes/Codecs.html#M000048">Codecs#pack</a>, unpack to improve
performance when packing/unpacking more commonly used types

</li>
<li>added <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Application.html#M000403">Appscript::Application#AS_new_reference</a>;
this takes a generic/aem reference and returns an appscript reference

</li>
<li>referencerenderer now displays accurate representation of an appscript
reference when appscript-style representation is unavailable (previously
rendered the appscript reference as an aem-style reference string, which
was misleading)

</li>
<li>tweaked APIs for UnitTypeCodecs&#8217; pack/unpack procs

</li>
<li>moved problem apps chapter to website

</li>
<li>added information on osadict to getting help chapter

</li>
<li>renamed aem&#8217;s userproperty method to user_property

</li>
<li>modified AEM_resolve to dispatch method calls via send. Client objects
should now either implement all aem reference methods OR a send(name,
*args) method. Clients should avoid using method_missing as that can cause
problems if client code includes methods into Object, as those injected
methods may then be called instead of method_missing.

</li>
<li>appscript now unpacks AEAddressDescs as <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Application.html">Appscript::Application</a>
instances (note: as with AppleScript, this behaviour is asymmetrical since
application objects always pack as null descs, i.e. they&#8217;re treated
as references when packing)

</li>
<li>added <a
href="../classes/Appscript/Application.html#M000401">Appscript::Application#by_aem_app</a>
method for converting <a
href="../classes/AEM/Application.html">AEM::Application</a> instances to
appscript application objects

</li>
<li>iTunes_top40_to_html.rb sample script now opens resulting HTML file in
user&#8217;s default web browser

</li>
<li>removed MacTypes::Units.method_missing

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Appscript/Reference.html">Appscript::Reference</a> and
<a
href="../classes/Appscript/GenericReference.html">Appscript::GenericReference</a>
now inherit from SafeObject class (based on BasicObject class <<a
href="http://facets.rubyforge.org">facets.rubyforge.org</a>>) to prevent
any third-party methods added to base classes from showing up in
Reference/GenericReference and interfering with method_missing&#8217;s
behaviour. Note that _appscript/safeobject.rb installs traps on
Module#method_added and Module#included in order to detect any changes
during runtime.

</li>
<li>added <a href="../classes/OSAX.html#M000442">OSAX#osax</a> and
OSAX#scripting_addition to allow these methods to be included for
convenience

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/FindApp.html#M000171">FindApp.by_name</a> now always
raises ApplicationNotFoundError when application not found (previously
sometimes raised RuntimeError

</li>
<li>added more tests

</li>
<li>fixed bug in MacTypes::FileBase#== where comparing two Alias/FileURL
objects with different paths would return true, not false, and generally
improved its behaviour

</li>
<li>added default value (&#8216;StandardAdditions&#8217;) for <a
href="../classes/OSAX.html#M000442">OSAX.osax</a>&#8217;s name argument

</li>
<li>added Add_iCal_event.rb, Export_Address_Book_phone_numbers.rb examples;
updated Hello_World.rb example to also demonstrate <a
href="../classes/OSAX.html">OSAX</a> usage; made Select_all_HTML_files.rb
example clearer

</li>
<li>improved handling of synonyms in <a
href="../classes/Terminology.html">Terminology</a>, <a
href="../classes/TerminologyParser.html">TerminologyParser</a> modules
(definitions with same codes but different names are now retained;
previously only the last-found definition was retained). Still
doesn&#8217;t mimic AS&#8217;s behaviour 100%, but it&#8217;s difficult to
get any closer without studying the original AS source code.

</li>
<li>added <a href="../classes/Terminology.html#M000320">Terminology.dump</a>
method; removed misc/dump.rb file

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-11-29 &#8212; 0.2.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>renamed AS module to <a href="../classes/Appscript.html">Appscript</a>. An
&#8216;AS&#8217; alias is temporarily provided for backwards compatibility
but this will be removed in a future release. Users should update their
scripts accordingly.

</li>
<li>_appscript/referencerenderer.rb no longer prefixes &#8216;AS.&#8217; to
reference representation strings

</li>
<li>added app, con and its instance methods to <a
href="../classes/Appscript.html">Appscript</a> module to allow clients to
include appscript methods and classes in other modules via &#8216;include
Appscript&#8217;; updated sample scripts and documentation to show this

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/OSAX.html#M000441">OSAX.scripting_additions</a> now
returns unique sorted names

</li>
<li>added <a
href="../classes/MacTypes/Alias.html#M000181">MacTypes::Alias.url</a>, <a
href="../classes/MacTypes/Alias.html#M000181">MacTypes::Alias#url</a>,
MacTypes::File_URL.url, MacTypes::File_URL#url methods for working with
file url strings

</li>
<li><a
href="../classes/OSAX/ScriptingAddition.html#M000446">OSAX::ScriptingAddition#to_s</a>
and inspect now render scripting addition&#8217;s name correctly

</li>
<li>removed unused AE.pid_to_psn method

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-11-20 &#8212; 0.2.0
</p>
<ul>
<li>removed path expansion in FindApp#byName, MacFile::Alias#at,
MacFile::FileURL#at

</li>
<li>changed default send flags to KAE::KAECanSwitchLayer + KAE::KAEWaitReply
(same as AppleScript)

</li>
<li>aliased AE::MacOSError#number to to_i; added to_s and inspect methods

</li>
<li>added to_s and inspect methods to AE::AEDesc

</li>
<li>fixed undefined variable bug in FindApp#byName when raising an
ApplicationNotFoundError

</li>
<li>added osax module and documentation

</li>
<li>added event handling code to rbae.c (not yet fully tested)

</li>
<li>added gemspec for source-based gem

</li>
<li>made Reference class&#8217;s AS_appdata and AS_aemreference instance
variables writeable as well as readable - this&#8217;ll make it easier to
inject workarounds (e.g. modified pack/unpack routines) for occasional
application flaws

</li>
<li>added sample scripts: Organize_Mail_messages.rb,
Create_daily_iCal_todos.rb, Simple_Finder_GUI_Scripting.rb,
Set_iChat_status.rb

</li>
<li>now always packs a subject attribute (KAE::TypeSubjectAttr); this is
normally a null descriptor. (Note: AS includes a subject attribute for
commands whose direct parameter isn&#8217;t a reference, e.g. make.
Photoshop CS2&#8217;s make command requires either an &#8216;at&#8217;
parameter or subject attribute and throws an error if it doesn&#8217;t get
one. Including a subject attribute by default should hopefully prevent any
complaints.) [BB]

</li>
<li>removed built-in :telltarget argument to simplify the API a bit. Now, if a
command is called on a reference and already has a direct parameter, the
reference is packed as the subject attribute instead. Also,
&#8216;telltarget&#8217; is no longer a reserved word.

</li>
<li>true and false are now packed as AEDescs of typeTrue and typeFalse (same as
AppleScript), not typeBoolean [BB]

</li>
<li>when hashes containing a :class or AEType.new(&#8216;pcls&#8217;) key whose
value is a Symbol or AEBaseType instance are packed, the resulting AEDesc
is now coerced to that type (previously the class property was packed as
just another key-value pair, and the result was an AEDesc of typeAERecord)
[BB]

</li>
<li>codecs module now unpacks a record-like AEDesc with an unknown type as a
hash containing an additional &#8216;class&#8217; property that indicates
the original type (i.e. same as AppleScript)

</li>
<li>aliased AEM::CommandError#number to to_i

</li>
<li>where property and element names are the same (e.g. file, text in BBEdit),
appscript now packs this as a property specifier, unless the name is
&#8216;text&#8217;, in which case it&#8217;s packed as an elements
specifier (i.e. [hopefully] same as AppleScript)

</li>
<li>renamed macfile.rb/MacFile module to mactypes.rb/MacTypes

</li>
<li>renamed <a href="../classes/MacTypes/Alias.html">MacTypes::Alias</a>,
MacTypes::MacFileURL methods:

<pre>
      Alias.at -&gt; Alias.path
      FileURL.at -&gt; FileURL.path
      Alias.newDesc -&gt; Alias.desc
      FileURL.newDesc -&gt; FileURL.desc
</pre>
</li>
<li>renamed AS.app methods:

<pre>
      app#byName -&gt; app#by_name
      app#byCreator -&gt; app#by_creator
      app#byID -&gt; app#by_id
      app#byPID -&gt; app#by_pid
      app#byURL -&gt; app#by_url
</pre>
</li>
<li>renamed appscript reference methods:

<pre>
      startswith -&gt; starts_with
      endswith -&gt; ends_with
      isin -&gt; is_in
      doesnotstartwith -&gt; does_not_start_with
      doesnotendwith -&gt; does_not_end_with
      doesnotcontain -&gt; does_not_contain
      isnotin -&gt; is_not_in
</pre>
</li>
<li>renamed built-in appscript command parameters:

<pre>
      :waitreply -&gt; :wait_reply
      :resulttype -&gt; :result_type
</pre>
</li>
<li>renamed <a href="../classes/AEM/Application.html">AEM::Application</a>
methods:

<pre>
      Application.newPath -&gt; Application.by_path
      Application.newURL -&gt; Application.by_url
      Application.newPID -&gt; Application.by_pid
      Application.newAEDesc -&gt; Application.by_desc
</pre>
</li>
<li>renamed aem reference methods:

<pre>
      byindex -&gt; by_index
      byname -&gt; by_name
      byid -&gt; by_id
      byrange -&gt; by_range

      startswith -&gt; starts_with
      endswith -&gt; ends_with
      isin -&gt; is_in
</pre>
</li>
<li>renamed <a href="../classes/FindApp.html">FindApp</a> methods:

<pre>
      FindApp.byName -&gt; FindApp.by_name
      FindApp.byCreator -&gt; FindApp.by_creator
      FindApp.byID -&gt; FindApp.by_id
</pre>
</li>
<li>changed type names in defaultterminology.rb to be more AppleScript-like,
e.g. :String -> :string, :MissingValue -> :missing_value (note that there
are still a few deliberate differences, e.g. :float instead of :real)

</li>
<li>added month and weekday name-code definitions to defaultterminology.rb

</li>
<li>changed internal variable and method names to follow Ruby style guidelines

</li>
<li>added <a href="../classes/MacTypes/Units.html">MacTypes::Units</a> class

</li>
<li>added add_unit_types method to <a href="../classes/Codecs.html">Codecs</a>
class, allowing additional unit type definitions to be added

</li>
<li>fixed appscript reference rendering bug where property/element names could
get muddled (e.g. &#8216;document&#8217; property would appear as
&#8216;documents&#8217;)

</li>
<li>fixed wierd rendering bug where rendered references would be invisible if
client script contained an &#8216;app&#8217; method of its own (Ruby was
invoking this instead of ReferenceRenderer#method_missing)

</li>
<li>moved findapp.rb and mactypes.rb to _aem/ (they&#8217;re already
re-exported by aem.rb, appscript.rb, etc. so clients don&#8217;t need to
require them directly)

</li>
<li>&#8216;help&#8217; is now a reserved word (though is not currently
implemented)

</li>
<li>Attempting to pack invalid UTF8 strings now raises TypeError instead of
AEM::NotUTF8TextError

</li>
<li>changed AEM::Application#running? to AEM::Application.is_running?(path)

</li>
<li>added aem manual

</li>
<li>replaced big if...elsif... block in <a
href="../classes/Codecs.html#M000048">Codecs#pack</a> with case block

</li>
<li>removed AEM::AEEventName (the &#8216;evnt&#8217; type, cEventIdentifier, is
used by OSAGetHandlerNames)

</li>
<li>updated kae.rb; now contains constants scraped from the following OS X
10.4u SDK frameworks:

<pre>
      AE.framework (all headers)
      Carbon.framework (AEInteraction.h only)
      OpenScripting.framework (all headers except FinderRegistry.h)
</pre>
</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Connect.html#M000167">Connect.local_app_by_pid</a> now
returns an AEDesc of typeKernelProcessID

</li>
<li>added basic support for equality tests and hashing to MacFile::Alias and
MacFile::URL. Note that it only tests for exact data equality; two objects
that identify the same filesystem object/location by different means, using
paths of different case, etc. will test as false.

</li>
<li>adjusted packing of &#8216;make&#8217; command so that if target reference
is typeObjectSpecifier then it&#8217;s packed as the subject attribute but
if it&#8217;s typeInsertionLoc it&#8217;s packed as an &#8216;at&#8217;
parameter (this avoids a bug in Cocoa Scripting where packing an insertion
location as the subject attribute results in an error when CS tries to
coerce it to an object specifier)

</li>
<li>fixed various bugs in aem&#8217;s transaction-handling code

</li>
<li>added abort_transaction and added optional &#8216;session&#8217; argument
to start_transaction in <a
href="../classes/AEM/Application.html">AEM::Application</a> and
AS::Application

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-23 &#8212; 0.1.6
</p>
<ul>
<li>improved test_aemreference.rb

</li>
<li>fixed bug in aemreference.rb where comparing two non-equivalent aem
references could return true

</li>
<li>simplified four-char-code conversion routines in codecs.rb

</li>
<li>AS::Reference#methods now returns names of application-defined properties,
elements and commands in addition to names of built-in methods [MN]

</li>
<li>AS::Reference#respond_to? now returns true for names of application-defined
properties, elements and commands in addition to names of built-in methods
[MN]

</li>
<li>removed rbosadict; use ASDictionary.app instead (available from <<a
href="http://appscript.sourceforge.net">appscript.sourceforge.net</a>>)

</li>
<li>removed AS::Application#useterminology; added optional &#8216;terms&#8217;
argument to Application constructors instead

</li>
<li>in <a href="../classes/Terminology.html">Terminology</a> module, changed
timeout for ascrgdte event from 120 to 30 sec

</li>
<li>added dump tool + documentation

</li>
<li>added info to manual on scripting non-stay-open applications

</li>
<li>removed MacFile::Alias#newPath and MacFile::FileURL#newPath constructors
(use at instead)

</li>
<li>changed MacFile::Alias#to_s and MacFile::FileURL#to_s to return plain path
string instead of object representation (use inspect for that)

</li>
<li>removed MacFile::Alias#path and MacFile::FileURL#path (use to_s instead)

</li>
<li>added macfile manual

</li>
<li>Connect.launch_app no longer waits for reply/error when sending a launch
event to an already running application

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-18 &#8212; 0.1.5
</p>
<ul>
<li>renamed MacFile::Alias#newPath, MacFile::FileURL#newPath to Alias#at and
FileURL#at for conciseness; e.g.: FileURL.at(&#8220;/some/path&#8220;).
Note: newPath methods will be removed in 0.2.0.

</li>
<li>appscript module now packs UInt32 csig attributes correctly [DH]

</li>
<li>fixed little-endian bugs when packing and unpacking typeSInt64 and
typeLongDateTime

</li>
<li>packing and unpacking typeLongDateTime AEDescs is now about as accurate as
can be expected, given the inherent problems of LongDateTime (i.e.
UCConvertLongDateTimeToCFAbsoluteTime and
UCConvertCFAbsoluteTimeToLongDateTime have off-by-an-hour [or whatever the
local difference is] inaccuracies at ST/DST/ST boundaries)

</li>
<li>improved error reporting in MacFile module: creating a MacFile::Alias
object with a path to a non-existent filesystem object, getting path for
MacFile::Alias object that no longer identifies a valid filesystem object,
etc. now raises MacFile::FileNotFoundError instead of various MacOSErrors

</li>
<li>comparison methods&#8217; arguments now display correctly when to_s/inspect
is called on its-based references

</li>
<li>its-based aem references now correctly unpack KAEContains comparison
descriptors as &#8216;reference.isin(value)&#8217;, rather than trying to
unpack them incorrectly as &#8216;value.contains(reference)&#8217;

</li>
<li>first/middle/last/any references now compare correctly with identical
references that have been previously packed and unpacked. Previously the
codecs module was unpacking them with different _key attributes, so
equality tests would always return false even when the two references were
identical.

</li>
<li>Attempting to pack invalid UTF8 strings now raises AEM::NotUTF8TextError
rather than AE::MacOSError -1700.

</li>
<li>fixed launch method (was calling non-existent Connect.launch, not
Connect.launchApp)

</li>
<li>attempting to retrieve aete resource from an application that doesn&#8217;t
have any terminology no longer raises &#8216;resource not found&#8217;
(-192) error

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/AEM.html">AEM</a> module now re-exports AE::MacOSError
class for convenience

</li>
<li>Apple Event Manager-raised errors that occur when sending events are now
reported correctly (was giving &#8216;uninitialized constant
Send::Event::None&#8217; errors)

</li>
<li>appscript referencerenderer module now renders class names in next and
previous references correctly

</li>
<li>GenericReference#to_s now includes &#8216;AS.&#8217; prefix when rendering
string representations of generic references

</li>
<li>fixed ==() methods in appscript Reference and aem Application classes

</li>
<li>implemented eql? methods so aem types, aem references and appscript
references should now work correctly as hash keys

</li>
<li>fixed endian bugs in <a href="../classes/Codecs.html">Codecs</a> when
unpacking insertion location selectors and comparison and logic operators

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-15 &#8212; 0.1.4
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed error message when reporting an unknown parameter (was showing
command name, not parameter name)

</li>
<li>fixed bug in TextEdit_demo.rb script (count command&#8217;s parameter
should be :each, not :each_)

</li>
<li>fixed bug where typeBoolean AEDescs would always unpack as true

</li>
<li>fixed bugs when packing and unpacking AEDescs of typeSInt64

</li>
<li>integers between 2*31 and 2**63-1 now pack as typeSInt64, not typeFloat

</li>
<li>[mostly] fixed timezone and winter/summer time bugs; there&#8217;s probably
still problems at the points where DST begins and ends (some of which may
be Ruby&#8217;s fault; this is still to be determined)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-13 &#8212; 0.1.3
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed a bug in appscript where the first argument in a command call would
be ignored if it was false or nil [MN]

</li>
<li>changed priority order for determining what an ambiguous keyword (e.g.
:workbook in Excel) that may be either a type or enumerator name should be
packed as; previously typeEnumerated was the default, now it&#8217;s
typeType [MN]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-12 &#8212; 0.1.2
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed a bug where appscript was unpacking typeEnumerated AEDescs as
AEM::AEEnums instead of Symbols [MN]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-10 &#8212; 0.1.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>made several corrections and improvements to appscript manual [MN]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
2006-10-09 &#8212; 0.1.0
</p>
<ul>
<li>first release

</li>
