</p>
<p>
## 0.3.8 (November 9th, 2011)

<ul>
<li>remove fiber support from mysql2, the code has moved to the em-synchrony
gem.

</li>
<li>use rb_wait_for_single_fd() if available

</li>
<li>fixed a bug with inheriting query options

</li>
<li>remove ext/ from the default loadpath

<li>ensure symbolized column names support encodings in 1.9

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.3.6 (June 17th, 2011)
</p>
<ul>
<li>fix bug in Time/DateTime range detection

</li>
<li>(win32) fix bug where the <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html">Mysql2::Client</a> object wasn&#8217;t
cleaned up properly if interrupted during a query

</li>
<li>add Mysql2::Result#count (aliased as size) to get the row count for the
dataset this can be especially helpful if you want to get the number of
rows without having to inflate the entire dataset into ruby (since this
happens lazily)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.3.5 (June 15th, 2011)
</p>
<ul>
<li>bug fix for Time/DateTime usage depending on 32/64bit Ruby

</li>
</ul>
<p>
## 0.3.4 (June 15th, 2011)
</p>
<ul>
<li>fix a long standing bug where a signal would interrupt rb_thread_select and

<li>added support for turning eager-casting off. This is especially useful in
ORMs that will lazily cast values upon access.

</li>
<li>added a warning if a 0.2.x release is being used with ActiveRecord 3.1
since both the 0.2.x releases and AR 3.1 have mysql2 adapters, we want you
to use the one in AR 3.1

or less)
