# <a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> - A modern, simple and very
fast Mysql library for Ruby - binding to libmysql
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> gem is meant to serve the
extremely common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating on results.
Some database libraries out there serve as direct 1:1 mappings of the
already complex C API&#8217;s available. This one is not.
</p>
<p>
It also forces the use of UTF-8 [or binary] for the connection [and all
strings in 1.9, unless Encoding.default_internal is set then it&#8217;ll
convert from UTF-8 to that encoding] and uses encoding-aware MySQL API
calls where it can.
</p>
<p>
The API consists of two classes:
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html">Mysql2::Client</a> - your
connection to the database
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mysql2/Result.html">Mysql2::Result</a> - returned from
issuing a query on the connection. It includes Enumerable.
</p>
<p>
## Installing
</p>
<p>
``` sh gem install mysql2 ```
</p>
<p>
You may have to specify
&#8212;with-mysql-config=/some/random/path/bin/mysql_config
</p>
<p>
## Usage
</p>
<p>
Connect to a database:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby # this takes a hash of options, almost all of which map directly #
to the familiar database.yml in rails # See <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/MysqlAdapter.html">api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/MysqlAdapter.html</a>
client = <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000000">Mysql2::Client.new</a>(:host
=> &#8220;localhost&#8221;, :username => &#8220;root&#8221;) ```
</p>
<p>
Then query it:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby results = client.query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM users WHERE
group=&#8217;githubbers&#8217;&#8221;) ```
</p>
<p>
Need to escape something first?
</p>
<p>
``` ruby escaped = client.escape(&#8220;gi&#8217;thu"bbe0r&#8217;s&#8221;)
results = client.query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM users WHERE
group=&#8217;#{escaped}&#8217;&#8221;) ```
</p>
<p>
You can get a count of your results with `results.count`.
</p>
<p>
Finally, iterate over the results:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby results.each do |row|
</p>
<pre>
  # conveniently, row is a hash
  # the keys are the fields, as you'd expect
  # the values are pre-built ruby primitives mapped from their corresponding field types in MySQL
  # Here's an otter: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/398077070_b8795d0ef3_b.jpg
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
Or, you might just keep it simple:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby client.query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM users WHERE
group=&#8217;githubbers&#8217;&#8221;).each do |row|
</p>
<pre>
  # do something with row, it's ready to rock
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
How about with symbolized keys?
</p>
<p>
``` ruby # NOTE: the :symbolize_keys and future options will likely move to
the query method soon client.query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM users WHERE
group=&#8217;githubbers&#8217;&#8221;).each(:symbolize_keys => true) do
|row|
</p>
<pre>
  # do something with row, it's ready to rock
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
You can get the headers and the columns in the order that they were
returned by the query like this:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby headers = results.fields # <= that&#8217;s an array of field
names, in order results.each(:as => :array) do |row| # Each row is an
array, ordered the same as the query results # An otter&#8217;s den is
called a &#8220;holt&#8221; or &#8220;couch&#8221; end ```
</p>
<p>
## Cascading config
</p>
<p>
The default config hash is at:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000001">Mysql2::Client.default_query_options</a>
```
</p>
<p>
which defaults to:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby {:async => false, :as => :hash, :symbolize_keys => false} ```
</p>
<p>
that can be used as so:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby # these are the defaults all <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html">Mysql2::Client</a> instances inherit
<a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000001">Mysql2::Client.default_query_options</a>.merge!(:as
=> :array) ```
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
``` ruby # this will change the defaults for all future results returned by
the query method _for this connection only_ c = <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000000">Mysql2::Client.new</a>
c.query_options.merge!(:symbolize_keys => true) ```
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
``` ruby # this will set the options for the <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Result.html">Mysql2::Result</a> instance returned
from the query method c = <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000000">Mysql2::Client.new</a>
c.query(sql, :symbolize_keys => true) ```
</p>
<p>
## Result types
</p>
<p>
### Array of Arrays
</p>
<p>
Pass the `:as => :array` option to any of the above methods of
configuration
</p>
<p>
### Array of Hashes
</p>
<p>
The default result type is set to :hash, but you can override a previous
setting to something else with :as => :hash
</p>
<p>
### Others&#8230;
</p>
<p>
I may add support for `:as => :csv` or even `:as => :json` to allow for
<b>much</b> more efficient generation of those data types from result sets.
If you&#8217;d like to see either of these (or others), open an issue and
start bugging me about it ;)
</p>
<p>
### Timezones
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> now supports two timezone
options:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby :database_timezone # this is the timezone <a
href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> will assume fields are already
stored as, and will use this when creating the initial Time objects in ruby
:application_timezone # this is the timezone <a
href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> will convert to before finally
handing back to the caller ```
</p>
<p>
In other words, if `:database_timezone` is set to `:utc` - <a
href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> will create the Time objects using
`Time.utc(...)` from the raw value libmysql hands over initially. Then, if
`:application_timezone` is set to say - `:local` - <a
href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> will then convert the just-created
UTC Time object to local time.
</p>
<p>
Both options only allow two values - `:local` or `:utc` - with the
exception that `:application_timezone` can be [and defaults to] nil
</p>
<p>
### Casting &#8220;boolean&#8221; columns
</p>
<p>
You can now tell <a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> to cast
`tinyint(1)` fields to boolean values in Ruby with the `:cast_booleans`
option.
</p>
<p>
``` ruby client = <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000000">Mysql2::Client.new</a> result
= client.query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM table_with_boolean_field&#8220;,
:cast_booleans => true) ```
</p>
<p>
### Skipping casting
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> casting is fast, but not as
fast as not casting data. In rare cases where typecasting is not needed, it
will be faster to disable it by providing :cast => false.
</p>
<p>
``` ruby client = <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Client.html#M000000">Mysql2::Client.new</a> result
= client.query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM table&#8221;, :cast => false) ```
</p>
<p>
Here are the results from the `query_without_mysql_casting.rb` script in
the benchmarks folder:
</p>
<p>
``` sh
</p>
<pre>
                           user     system      total        real
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> (cast: true) 0.340000 0.000000
0.340000 ( 0.405018) <a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> (cast:
false) 0.160000 0.010000 0.170000 ( 0.209937) Mysql 0.080000 0.000000
0.080000 ( 0.129355) do_mysql 0.520000 0.010000 0.530000 ( 0.574619) ```
</p>
<p>
Although <a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> performs reasonably
well at retrieving uncasted data, it (currently) is not as fast as the
Mysql gem. In spite of this small disadvantage, <a
href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> still sports a friendlier
interface and doesn&#8217;t block the entire ruby process when querying.
</p>
<p>
### Async
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Not supported on Windows.
</p>
<p>
`Mysql2::Client` takes advantage of the MySQL C API&#8217;s (undocumented)
non-blocking function mysql_send_query for <b>all</b> queries. But, in
order to take full advantage of it in your Ruby code, you can do:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby client.query(&#8220;SELECT sleep(5)&#8221;, :async => true) ```
</p>
<p>
Which will return nil immediately. At this point you&#8217;ll probably want
to use some socket monitoring mechanism like EventMachine or even
IO.select. Once the socket becomes readable, you can do:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby # result will be a <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Result.html">Mysql2::Result</a> instance result =
client.async_result ```
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Because of the way MySQL&#8217;s query API works, this method will
block until the result is ready. So if you really need things to stay
async, it&#8217;s best to just monitor the socket with something like
EventMachine. If you need multiple query concurrency take a look at using a
connection pool.
</p>
<p>
### Row Caching
</p>
<p>
By default, <a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a> will cache rows
that have been created in Ruby (since this happens lazily). This is
especially helpful since it saves the cost of creating the row in Ruby if
you were to iterate over the collection again.
</p>
<p>
If you only plan on using each row once, then it&#8217;s much more
efficient to disable this behavior by setting the `:cache_rows` option to
false. This would be helpful if you wanted to iterate over the results in a
streaming manner. Meaning the GC would cleanup rows you don&#8217;t need
anymore as you&#8217;re iterating over the result set.
</p>
<p>
## ActiveRecord
</p>
<p>
To use the ActiveRecord driver (with or without rails), all you should need
to do is have this gem installed and set the adapter in your database.yml
to &#8220;mysql2&#8221;. That was easy right? :)
</p>
<p>
NOTE: as of 0.3.0, and ActiveRecord 3.1 - the ActiveRecord adapter has been
pulled out of this gem and into ActiveRecord itself. If you need to use
mysql2 with Rails versions < 3.1 make sure and specify `gem
&#8220;mysql2&#8221;, &#8220;~> 0.2.7&#8220;` in your Gemfile
</p>
<p>
## Asynchronous ActiveRecord
</p>
<p>
Please see the [em-synchrony](<a
href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony">github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony</a>)
project for details about using EventMachine with mysql2 and Rails.
</p>
<p>
## Sequel
</p>
<p>
The Sequel adapter was pulled out into Sequel core (will be part of the
next release) and can be used by specifying the &#8220;mysql2://&#8221;
prefix to your connection specification.
</p>
<p>
## EventMachine
</p>
<p>
The mysql2 EventMachine deferrable api allows you to make async queries
using EventMachine, while specifying callbacks for success for failure.
Here&#8217;s a simple example:
</p>
<p>
``` ruby require &#8216;mysql2/em&#8216;
</p>
<p>
EM.run do
</p>
<pre>
  client1 = Mysql2::EM::Client.new
  defer1 = client1.query &quot;SELECT sleep(3) as first_query&quot;
  defer1.callback do |result|
    puts &quot;Result: #{result.to_a.inspect}&quot;
  end

  client2 = Mysql2::EM::Client.new
  defer2 = client2.query &quot;SELECT sleep(1) second_query&quot;
  defer2.callback do |result|
    puts &quot;Result: #{result.to_a.inspect}&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
## Lazy Everything
</p>
<p>
Well&#8230; almost ;)
</p>
<p>
Field name strings/symbols are shared across all the rows so only one
object is ever created to represent the field name for an entire dataset.
</p>
<p>
Rows themselves are lazily created in ruby-land when an attempt to yield it
is made via each. For example, if you were to yield 4 rows from a 100 row
dataset, only 4 hashes will be created. The rest will sit and wait in
C-land until you want them (or when the GC goes to cleanup your
`Mysql2::Result` instance). Now say you were to iterate over that same
collection again, this time yielding 15 rows - the 4 previous rows that had
already been turned into ruby hashes would be pulled from an internal
cache, then 11 more would be created and stored in that cache. Once the
entire dataset has been converted into ruby objects, <a
href="../classes/Mysql2/Result.html">Mysql2::Result</a> will free the Mysql
C result object as it&#8217;s no longer needed.
</p>
<p>
This caching behavior can be disabled by setting the :cache_rows option to
false.
</p>
<p>
As for field values themselves, I&#8217;m workin on it - but expect that
soon.
</p>
<p>
## Compatibility
</p>
<p>
The specs pass on my system (SL 10.6.3, x86_64) in these rubies:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1.8.7-p249

</li>
<li>ree-1.8.7-2010.01

</li>
<li>1.9.1-p378

</li>
<li>ruby-trunk

</li>
<li>rbx-head - broken at the moment, working with the rbx team for a solution

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ActiveRecord driver should work on 2.3.5 and 3.0
</p>
<p>
## Yeah&#8230; but why?
</p>
<p>
Someone: Dude, the Mysql gem works fiiiiiine.
</p>
<p>
Me: It sure does, but it only hands you nil and strings for field values.
Leaving you to convert them into proper Ruby types in Ruby-land - which is
slow as balls.
</p>
<p>
Someone: OK fine, but do_mysql can already give me back values with Ruby
objects mapped to MySQL types.
</p>
<p>
Me: Yep, but it&#8217;s API is considerably more complex <b>and</b> can be
~2x slower.
</p>
<p>
## Benchmarks
</p>
<p>
Performing a basic &#8220;SELECT * FROM&#8221; query on a table with 30k
rows and fields of nearly every Ruby-representable data type, then
iterating over every row using an each like method yielding a block:
</p>
<p>
These results are from the `query_with_mysql_casting.rb` script in the
benchmarks folder
</p>
<p>
``` sh
</p>
<pre>
 user       system     total       real
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mysql2.html">Mysql2</a>
</p>
<pre>
 0.750000   0.180000   0.930000 (  1.821655)
</pre>
<p>
do_mysql
</p>
<pre>
 1.650000   0.200000   1.850000 (  2.811357)
</pre>
<p>
Mysql
</p>
<pre>
 7.500000   0.210000   7.710000 (  8.065871)
</pre>
<p>
```
</p>
<p>
## Development
</p>
<p>
To run the tests, you can use RVM and Bundler to create a pristine
environment for mysql2 development/hacking. Use &#8216;bundle
install&#8217; to install the necessary development and testing gems:
</p>
<p>
``` sh bundle install rake ```
</p>
<p>
The tests require the &#8220;test&#8221; database to exist, and expect to
connect both as root and the running user, both with a blank password:
</p>
<p>
``` sql CREATE DATABASE test; CREATE USER
&#8217;<user>&#8217;@&#8217;localhost&#8217; IDENTIFIED BY &#8217;&#8217;;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO
&#8217;<user>&#8217;@&#8217;localhost&#8217;; ```
</p>
