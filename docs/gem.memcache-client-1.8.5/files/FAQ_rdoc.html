        <h1>Memcache-client FAQ</h1>
<h2>Does memcache-client work with Ruby 1.9?</h2>
<p>
Yes, Ruby 1.9 is supported. The test suite should pass completely on 1.8.6
and 1.9.1.
</p>
<h2>I&#8217;m seeing &#8220;execution expired&#8221; or &#8220;time&#8217;s up!&#8221; errors, what&#8217;s that all about?</h2>
<p>
memcache-client 1.6.x+ now has socket operations timed out by default. This
is to prevent the Ruby process from hanging if memcached or starling get
into a bad state, which has been seen in production by both 37signals and
FiveRuns. The default timeout is 0.5 seconds, which should be more than
enough time under normal circumstances. It&#8217;s possible to hit a storm
of concurrent events which cause this timer to expire: a large Ruby VM can
cause the GC to take a while, while also storing a large (500k-1MB value),
for example.
</p>
<p>
You can increase the timeout or disable them completely with the following
configuration:
</p>
<pre>
  Rails:
  config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, 'server1', 'server2', { :timeout =&gt; nil } # no timeout

  native:
  MemCache.new ['server1', 'server2'], { :timeout =&gt; 1.0 } # 1 second timeout
</pre>
<h2>Isn&#8217;t Evan Weaver&#8217;s memcached gem faster?</h2>
<p>
The latest version of memcached-client is anywhere from 33% to 100% slower
than memcached in various benchmarks. Keep in mind this means that 10,000
get requests take 1.8 sec instead of 1.2 seconds. In practice,
memcache-client is unlikely to be a bottleneck in your system but there is
always going to be an overhead to pure Ruby. memcache-client does have the
advantage of built-in integration into Rails and should work on non-MRI
platforms: JRuby, MacRuby, etc.
