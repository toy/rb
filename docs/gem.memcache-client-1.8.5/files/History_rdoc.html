 * Remove nag message (tenderlove)
</pre>
<h1>1.8.3 (2010-04-26)</h1>

</pre>
<h1>1.8.1 (2010-03-20)</h1>
<pre>
 * Only require SystemTimer if the Ruby VM looks like MRI.

<pre>
 * Add support for EventMachine-based connections.
 * Add support for raw values in get_multi
 * Add memcached_top binary for gathering server statistics
</pre>
<h1>1.7.8 (2010-02-03)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue where autofix_keys logic did not account for namespace length.
(menno)

</li>
<li>Fix issue when using memcache-client without rubygems. (anvar)

</li>
<li>Fix issue when using the cas method with raw=true (Takahiro Kikumoto)

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.7 (2009-11-24)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix invalid delete request in memcached 1.4.x. The expiry parameter to <a
href="../classes/MemCache.html#M000037">MemCache#delete</a> is now ignored
as memcached 1.4.x has dropped support for this feature.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.6 (2009-11-03)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reworked socket timeout code due to several customer complaints about
timeouts not working 100% of the time since 1.7.3.

</li>
<li>Add option to configure the namespace separator string, for interop with
Perl which does not use a separator character:

<pre>
  MemCache.new(servers, :namespace_separator =&gt; '')
</pre>
</li>
<li>Move to jeweler and gemcutter for RubyGem support.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.5 (2009-09-09)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix ruby warnings (josh)

</li>
<li>Make megabyte value size limit optional since Tokyo Tyrant can accept
values larger than 1MB. Use :check_size => false to disable the size check.
(jsl)

</li>
<li>Ruby 1.9 support for recent I/O changes.

</li>
<li>Fix duplicate value marshalling on server error. (rajiv)

</li>
<li>Added option :autofix_keys (disabled by default) to replace long keys with
md5 hashes (sd)

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.4 (2009-06-09)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue with raising timeout errors.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.3 (2009-06-06)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remove SystemTimer support, refactor I/O to use nonblocking operations.
Speeds up performance approx 100%. Timeouts basically have no overhead now!
(tenderlove)

</li>
<li>Update load logic to support SystemTimer running in Ruby Enterprise
Edition. Thanks to splattael on github for the comment.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.2 (2009-04-12)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Rollback socket timeout optimization. It does not work on all operating
systems and was a support headache.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.1 (2009-03-28)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations:

<ul>
<li>Rely on higher performance operating system socket timeouts for low-level
socket read/writes where possible, instead of the (slower) SystemTimer or
(slowest, unreliable) Timeout libraries.

</li>
<li>the native binary search is back! The recent performance tuning made the
binary search a bottleneck again so it had to return. It uses RubyInline to
compile the native extension and silently falls back to pure Ruby if
anything fails. Make sure you run: `gem install RubyInline` if you want
ultimate performance.

</li>
<li>the changes make memcache-client 100% faster than 1.7.0 in my performance
test on Ruby 1.8.6: 15 sec -> 8 sec.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix several logging issues.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.7.0 (2009-03-08)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go through the memcached protocol document and implement any commands not
already implemented:

<ul>
<li>cas

</li>
<li>append

</li>
<li>prepend

</li>
<li>replace

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Append and prepend only work with raw data since it makes no sense to
concatenate two Marshalled values together. The cas functionality should be
considered a prototype. Since I don&#8217;t have an application which uses
<tt>cas</tt>, I&#8217;m not sure what semantic sugar the API should
provide. Should it retry if the value was changed? Should it massage the
returned string into true/false? Feedback would be appreciated.
</p>
</li>
<li>Add fetch method which provides a method very similar to
ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#fetch, basically a wrapper around get and add.
(djanowski)

</li>
<li>Implement the flush_all delay parameter, to allow a large memcached farm to
be flushed gradually.

</li>
<li>Implement the noreply flag, which tells memcached not to reply in
operations which don&#8217;t need a reply, i.e. set/add/delete/flush_all.

</li>
<li>The only known functionality not implemented anymore is the <flags>
parameter to the storage commands. This would require modification of the
API method signatures. If someone can come up with a clean way to implement
it, I would be happy to consider including it.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.6.5 (2009-02-27)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Change memcache-client to multithreaded by default. The mutex does not add
significant overhead and it is far too easy, now that Sinatra, Rails and
Merb are all thread-safe, to use memcache-client in a thread-unsafe manner.
Remove some unnecessary mutexing and add a test to verify heavily
multithreaded usage does not act unexpectedly.

</li>
<li>Add optional support for the SystemTimer gem when running on Ruby 1.8.x.
This gem is highly recommended - it ensures timeouts actually work and
halves the overhead of using timeouts. Using this gem, Ruby 1.8.x is
actually faster in my performance tests than Ruby 1.9.x. Just &#8220;gem
install SystemTimer&#8221; and it should be picked up automatically.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.6.4 (2009-02-19)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remove native code altogether. The speedup was only 10% on Ruby 1.8.6 and
did not work on Ruby 1.9.1.

</li>
<li>Removed memcache_util.rb from the distribution. If you are using it, please
copy the code into your own project. The file will live in the github
repository for a few more months for this purposes. <a
href="http://github.com/mperham/memcache-client/raw/7a276089aa3c914e47e3960f9740ac7377204970/lib/memcache_util.rb">github.com/mperham/memcache-client/raw/7a276089aa3c914e47e3960f9740ac7377204970/lib/memcache_util.rb</a>

</li>
<li>Roll continuum.rb into memcache.rb. The project is again a single Ruby
file, with no dependencies.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.6.3 (2009-02-14)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remove gem native extension in preference to RubyInline. This allows the
gem to install

</li>
</ul>
<p>
and work on JRuby and Ruby 1.8.5 when the native code fails to compile.
</p>
<h1>1.6.2 (2009-02-04)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Validate that values are less than one megabyte in size.

</li>
<li>Refactor error handling in get_multi to handle server failures and return
what values we could successfully retrieve.

</li>
<li>Add optional logging parameter for debugging and tracing.

</li>
<li>First official release since 1.5.0. Thanks to Eric Hodel for turning over
the project to me! New project home page: <a
href="http://github.com/mperham/memcache-client">github.com/mperham/memcache-client</a>

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.6.1 (2009-01-28)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Add option to disable socket timeout support. Socket timeout has a
significant performance penalty (approx 3x slower than without in Ruby
1.8.6). You can turn off the timeouts if you need absolute performance, but
by default timeouts are enabled. The performance penalty is much lower in
Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9 and JRuby. (mperham)

</li>
<li>Add option to disable server failover. Failover can lead to
&#8220;split-brain&#8221; caches that return stale data. (mperham)

</li>
<li>Implement continuum binary search in native code for performance reasons.
Pure ruby is available for platforms like JRuby or Rubinius which
can&#8217;t use C extensions. (mperham)

</li>
<li>Fix add with raw=true (iamaleksey)

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.6.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implement a consistent hashing algorithm, as described in libketama. This
dramatically reduces the cost of adding or removing servers dynamically as
keys are much more likely to map to the same server.

<p>
Take a scenario where we add a fourth server. With a naive modulo
algorithm, about 25% of the keys will map to the same server. In other
words, 75% of your memcached content suddenly becomes invalid. With a
consistent algorithm, 75% of the keys will map to the same server as before
- only 25% will be invalidated. (mperham)
</p>
</li>
<li>Implement socket timeouts, should fix rare cases of very bad things
happening in production at 37signals and FiveRuns. (jseirles)

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.5.0.5</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remove native C CRC32_ITU_T extension in favor of Zlib&#8217;s crc32
method. memcache-client is now pure Ruby again and will work with JRuby and
Rubinius.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.5.0.4</h1>
<ul>
<li>Get test suite working again (packagethief)

</li>
<li>Ruby 1.9 compatiblity fixes (packagethief, mperham)

</li>
<li>Consistently return server responses and check for errors (packagethief)

</li>
<li>Properly calculate CRC in Ruby 1.9 strings (mperham)

</li>
<li>Drop rspec in favor of test/unit, for 1.9 compat (mperham)

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.5.0.3 (FiveRuns fork)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Integrated ITU-T CRC32 operation in native C extension for speed. Thanks to
Justin Balthrop!

</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.5.0.2 (FiveRuns fork)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Add support for seamless failover between servers. If one server connection
dies,

</li>
</ul>
<p>
the client will retry the operation on another server before giving up.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge Will Bryant&#8217;s socket retry patch.
