Meet king kikker, kicking stuff in your computers is his dream come true!

<em>Drawing by Manfred Stienstra. The character is purely fictional, so if
you feel offended; live with it.</em>
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre>
  $ gem install kicker -s http://gemcutter.org
</pre>
<h2>The short version</h2>
<pre>
  Usage: ./bin/kicker [options] [paths to watch]

    Available recipes: active_record, ignore, jstest, rails, ruby.

      -s, --silent                     Keep output to a minimum.
          --[no-]growl                 Whether or not to use Growl. Default is to use growl.
          --growl-command [COMMAND]    The command to execute when the Growl succeeded message is clicked.
      -l, --latency [FLOAT]            The time to collect file change events before acting on them. Defaults to 1 second.
      -r, --recipe [NAME]              A named recipe to load.
      -e, --execute [COMMAND]          The command to execute.
      -b, --ruby [PATH]                Use an alternate Ruby binary for spawned test runners. (Default is `ruby')
</pre>
<h2>The long version</h2>
<h3>Execute a shell command</h3>
<p>
Show all files, whenever a change occurs in the current work directory:
</p>
<pre>
  $ kicker -e &quot;ls -l&quot; .
</pre>
<p>
Show all files, whenever a change occurs to a specific file:
</p>
<pre>
  $ kicker -e &quot;ls -l&quot; foo.txt
</pre>
<p>
Or use it as a ghetto-autotest, running tests whenever files change:
</p>
<pre>
  $ kicker -e &quot;ruby test/test_case.rb&quot; test/test_case.rb lib/file.rb
</pre>
<p>
Et cetera.
</p>
<h3>Using recipes</h3>
<p>
A recipe is a predefined handler. You can use as many as you like, by
specifying them with the <tt>--recipe</tt> (<tt>-r</tt>) option.
</p>
<p>
For instance, when in the root of a typical <a
href="../classes/Ruby.html">Ruby</a> on <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application, using the
<tt>rails</tt> recipe will map models, concerns, controllers, helpers, and
views to their respective test files. These will then all be ran with <a
href="../classes/Ruby.html">Ruby</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few recipes come shipped with Kicker:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical <a href="../classes/Ruby.html">Ruby</a> library.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Ruby.html">Ruby</a> on <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, as aforementioned.

</li>
<li>JavaScript tests, to run it needs <a
href="http://github.com/Fingertips/Headless-squirrel">HeadlessSquirrel</a>.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Ignore.html">Ignore</a>, ignores logs, tmp, and svn and
git files.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Add your own shared recipes to <tt>~/.kick</tt>.
</p>
<h3>Project specific handlers</h3>
<p>
Most of the time, you’ll want to create handlers specific to the project
at hand. This can be done by adding your handlers to a <tt>.kick</tt> file
and running Kicker from the directory containing it.
</p>
<p>
This file is reloaded once saved. No need to stop Kicker.
</p>
<h2>Writing handlers</h2>
<p>
Whenever file-change events occur, Kicker will go through a chain of
handlers until that the files list is empty, or the end of the chain is
reached.
</p>
<p>
Handlers are objects that respond to <tt>call</tt>. These are typically
Proc objects. (If you know Rack, you’re familiar with this concept.)
Every handler gets passed a list of changed files and can decide whether or
not to act on them. Normally when handling a file, you should remove it
from the files list, unless you want to let the file fall through to
another handler. In the same way, one can add files to handler to the files
list.
</p>
<h4>Time for a simple example</h4>
<pre>
  process do |files|
    execute(&quot;rake docs:generate &amp;&amp; open -a Safari html/index.html&quot;) if files.delete(&quot;README.rdoc&quot;)
  end
</pre>
<p>
A handler is defined by passing a block to <tt>process</tt>. Which is one
of three possible callback chains to add your handlers to, the others
being: <tt>pre_process</tt> and <tt>post_process</tt>. See <a
href="../classes/Kernel.html">Kernel</a> for more info.
</p>
<p>
Then <tt><a href="README_rdoc.html">README.rdoc</a></tt> is deleted from
the files array. If it did exist in the array and was deleted, a shell
command is executed which runs a rake task to generate rdoc and open the
docs with Safari.
</p>
<h4>Something more elaborate.</h4>
<p>
Consider a <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application with a
mailer. Since the naming convention of mailer views tend to be fairly
application specific, a specific handler has to be added:
</p>
<pre>
  process do |files|
    test_files = files.take_and_map do |file|
      if path =~ %r{^app/views/mailer/\w+\.erb$}
        'test/unit/mailer_test.rb'

      # elsif ... handle more app specific stuff
      end
    end

    Ruby.run_tests test_files
  end
</pre>
<p>
The files list is iterated over with the Array#take_and_map method, which
both removes and maps the results. This is an easy way to do a common thing
in recipes. See <a
href="../classes/Kicker/ArrayExt.html">Kicker::ArrayExt</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
The handler then checks if the file is a mailer view and if so runs the
mailers test case. <a
href="../classes/Ruby.html#M000049">Ruby.run_tests</a> runs them with
something like the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  execute &quot;ruby -r #{test_files.join(' -r ')} -e ''&quot; unless test_files.empty?
</pre>
<p>
See <a href="../classes/Kernel.html">Kernel</a> for more info on the
utility methods.
</p>
<p>
To load recipes from your <tt>~/.kick</tt> file:
</p>
<pre>
  recipe :ignore
  ignore(/^data\//)
</pre>
<p>
That’s basically it, just remember that the order of specifying handlers
<em>can</em> be important in your decision on where to specify handlers.
