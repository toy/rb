    * Maxim Chernyak for the initial conversion work to Rails 3
    * Tim Harper for ironing out various matcher bugs
    * Patrick Muldoon for doing a fantastic job of cleaning up the features and specs.  He also fixed the
      DelayedJob support and worked through all the bundler issues the project was facing.

<p>
This release is a general refactoring of the steps and helpers. The example
rails app was also updated to use the lateset rails and webrat. It also
takes advantages and the newer step definistions including the new
third-person forms.
</p>
<p>
Some of the generated steps are being removed in favor of some of the newer
ones. The older ones will remain until 0.4.0 but will issue deprecation
warnings.
</p>
<p>
Big shoutout to Kieran Pilkington who did the majority of work for this
release.
