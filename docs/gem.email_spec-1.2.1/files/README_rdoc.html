        <h1>Email Spec</h1>
<p>
A collection of RSpec matchers and Cucumber steps to make testing emails go
smoothly.
</p>
<p>
This library works with ActionMailer and <a
href="../classes/Pony.html">Pony</a>. When using it with ActionMailer it
works with DelayedJob, ActiveRecord Mailer, and
action_mailer_cache_delivery.
</p>
<p>
When using the action_mailer_cache_delivery library you must use this fork:
<a
href="http://github.com/liangzan/action_mailer_cache_delivery">github.com/liangzan/action_mailer_cache_delivery</a>
</p>
<p>
If you are testing emails in conjunction with an automated browser
solution, like Selenium, you will want to use action_mailer_cache_delivery
in your test environment. (This is because your test process and server
processes are distinct and therefore need an intermediate store for the
emails.) DelayedJob and ActiveRecord Mailer will also work but you
generally don&#8217;t want to include those projects unless you need them
in production.
</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<pre>
  script/plugin install git://github.com/bmabey/email-spec.git
</pre>
<h3>Gem Setup</h3>
<pre>
  gem install email_spec

  # Gemfile
  group :test do
    gem 'email_spec'
  end
</pre>
<h3>Cucumber</h3>
<p>
To use the steps in features put the following in your env.rb:
</p>
<pre>
  # Make sure this require is after you require cucumber/rails/world.
  require 'email_spec' # add this line if you use spork
  require 'email_spec/cucumber'
</pre>
<p>
This will load all the helpers that the steps rely on. It will also add a
Before hook for Cucumber so that emails are cleared at the start of each
scenario.
</p>
<p>
Then:
</p>
<pre>
  rails generate email_spec:steps
</pre>
<p>
This will give you a bunch of steps to get started with in
step_definitions/email_steps.rb
</p>
<p>
By default, the generated file will look for email to example@example.com.
You can either change this by editing the current_email_address method in
email_steps.rb, or by simply specifying the target email in your features:
</p>
<pre>
  Scenario: A new person signs up
      Given I am at &quot;/&quot;
      When I fill in &quot;Email&quot; with &quot;quentin@example.com&quot;
      And I press &quot;Sign up&quot;
      And &quot;quentin@example.com&quot; should receive an email   # Specify who should receive the email
</pre>
<h3>RSpec</h3>
<p>
First you need to require email_spec in your spec_helper.rb:
</p>
<pre>
  require &quot;email_spec&quot;
</pre>
<p>
You will then need to include <a
href="../classes/EmailSpec/Helpers.html">EmailSpec::Helpers</a> and <a
href="../classes/EmailSpec/Matchers.html">EmailSpec::Matchers</a> in your
example groups. If you want to have access to the helpers and matchers in
all of your examples you can do the following in your spec_helper.rb:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include(EmailSpec::Helpers)
    config.include(EmailSpec::Matchers)
  end
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you will need to include them in the example groups you wish to
use them:
</p>
<pre>
  describe &quot;Signup Email&quot; do
    include EmailSpec::Helpers
    include EmailSpec::Matchers
    ...
  end
</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Cucumber</h3>
<pre>
  Scenario: A new person signs up
      Given I am at &quot;/&quot;
      When I fill in &quot;Email&quot; with &quot;quentin@example.com&quot;
      And I press &quot;Sign up&quot;
      And I should receive an email
      When I open the email
      Then I should see &quot;confirm&quot; in the email body
      When I follow &quot;confirm&quot; in the email
      Then I should see &quot;Confirm your new account&quot;
</pre>
<p>
For more examples, check out examples/rails_root in the source for a small
example app that implements these steps.
</p>
<h3>RSpec</h3>
<h4>Testing In Isolation</h4>
<p>
It is often useful to test your mailers in isolation. You can accomplish
this by using mocks to verify that the mailer is being called in the
correct place and then write focused examples for the actual mailer. This
is a simple example from the sample app found in the gem:
</p>
<p>
Verify that the mailer is used correctly in the controller (this would
apply to a model as well):
</p>
<pre>
  describe &quot;POST /signup (#signup)&quot; do
    it &quot;should deliver the signup email&quot; do
      # expect
      UserMailer.should_receive(:deliver_signup).with(&quot;email@example.com&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Bean&quot;)
      # when
      post :signup, &quot;Email&quot; =&gt; &quot;email@example.com&quot;, &quot;Name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Jimmy Bean&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
Examples for the signup method in UserMailer:
</p>
<pre>
  describe &quot;Signup Email&quot; do
    include EmailSpec::Helpers
    include EmailSpec::Matchers
    include ActionController::UrlWriter

    before(:all) do
      @email = UserMailer.create_signup(&quot;jojo@yahoo.com&quot;, &quot;Jojo Binks&quot;)
    end

    it &quot;should be set to be delivered to the email passed in&quot; do
      @email.should deliver_to(&quot;jojo@yahoo.com&quot;)
    end

    it &quot;should contain the user's message in the mail body&quot; do
      @email.should have_body_text(/Jojo Binks/)
    end

    it &quot;should contain a link to the confirmation link&quot; do
      @email.should have_body_text(/#{confirm_account_url}/)
    end

    it &quot;should have the correct subject&quot; do
      @email.should have_subject(/Account confirmation/)
    end

  end
</pre>
<h4>Using the helpers when not testing in isolation</h4>
<p>
Don&#8217;t. :) Seriously, if you do just take a look at the helpers and
use them as you wish.
