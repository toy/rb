# OmniAuth: Standardized Multi-Provider Authentication
</p>
<p>
**<a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> 1.0 has several breaking
changes from version 0.x. You can set the dependency to `~> 0.3.2` if you
do not wish to make the more difficult upgrade. See [the wiki](<a
href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Upgrading-to-1.0">github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Upgrading-to-1.0</a>)
for more information.**
</p>
<p>
## An Introduction
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> is a libary that
standardizes multi-provider authentication for web applications. It was
created to be powerful, flexible, and do as little as possible. Any
developer can create *<b>strategies</b>* for <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> that can authenticate users
via disparate systems. <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a>
strategies have been created for everything from Facebook to LDAP.
</p>
<p>
In order to use <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> in your
applications, you will need to leverage one or more strategies. These
strategies are generally released individually as RubyGems, and you can see
a [community maintained list](<a
href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies">github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies</a>)
on the wiki for this project.
</p>
<p>
One strategy, called `Developer`, is included with <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> and provides a completely
unsecure, non-production-usable strategy that directly prompts a user for
authentication information and then passes it straight through. You can use
it as a placeholder when you start development and easily swap in other
strategies later.
</p>
<p>
## Getting Started
</p>
<p>
Each <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> strategy is a Rack
Middleware. That means that you can use it the same way that you use any
other Rack middleware. For example, to use the built-in Developer strategy
in a Sinatra application I might do this:
</p>
<p>
```ruby require &#8216;sinatra&#8217; require &#8216;omniauth&#8217;
</p>
<p>
class MyApplication < Sinatra::Base
</p>
<pre>
  use Rack::Session
  use OmniAuth::Strategies::Developer
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
Because <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> is built for
<b>multi-provider</b> authentication, I may want to leave room to run
multiple strategies. For this, the built-in `OmniAuth::Builder` class gives
you an easy way to specify multiple strategies. Note that there is **no
difference** between the following code and using each strategy
individually as middleware. This is an example that you might put into a
Rails initializer at `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:
</p>
<p>
```ruby Rails.application.config.middleware.use <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth/Builder.html">OmniAuth::Builder</a> do
</p>
<pre>
  provider :developer unless Rails.env.production?
  provider :twitter, ENV['TWITTER_KEY'], ENV['TWITTER_SECRET']
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
You should look to the documentation for each provider you use for specific
initialization requirements.
</p>
<p>
## Integrating <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> Into Your
Application
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> is an extremely low-touch
library. It is designed to be a black box that you can send your
application&#8217;s users into when you need authentication and then get
information back. <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> was
intentionally built not to automatically associate with a User model or
make assumptions about how many authentication methods you might want to
use or what you might want to do with the data once a user has
authenticated. This makes <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a>
incredibly flexible. To use <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a>, you need only to redirect
users to `/auth/:provider`, where `:provider` is the name of the strategy
(for example, `developer` or `twitter`). From there, <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> will take over and take the
user through the necessary steps to authenticate them with the chosen
strategy.
</p>
<p>
Once the user has authenticated, what do you do next? <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> simply sets a special hash
called the Authentication Hash on the Rack environment of a request to
`/auth/:provider/callback`. This hash contains as much information about
the user as <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> was able to
glean from the utilized strategy. You should set up an endpoint in your
application that matches to the callback URL and then performs whatever
steps are necessary for your application. For example, in a Rails app I
would add a line in my `routes.rb` file like this:
</p>
<p>
```ruby match &#8217;/auth/:provider/callback&#8217;, to:
&#8216;sessionscreate&#8217; ```
</p>
<p>
And I might then have a `SessionsController` with code that looks something
like this:
</p>
<p>
```ruby class SessionsController < ApplicationController
</p>
<pre>
  def create
    @user = User.find_or_create_from_auth_hash(auth_hash)
    self.current_user = @user
    redirect_to '/'
  end

  protected

  def auth_hash
    request.env['omniauth.auth']
  end
</pre>
<p>
end ```
</p>
<p>
The `omniauth.auth` key in the environment hash gives me my Authentication
Hash which will contain information about the just authenticated user
including a unique id, the strategy they just used for authentication, and
personal details such as name and email address as available. For an
in-depth description of what the authentication hash might contain, see the
[Auth Hash Schema wiki page](<a
href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema">github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema</a>).
</p>
<p>
Note that <a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> does not perform
any actions beyond setting some environment information on the callback
request. It is entirely up to you how you want to implement the particulars
of your application&#8217;s authentication flow.

## Resources
</p>
<p>
The [<a href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a> Wiki](<a
href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki">github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki</a>)
has actively maintained in-depth documentation for <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a>. It should be your first stop
if you are wondering about a more in-depth look at <a
href="../classes/OmniAuth.html">OmniAuth</a>, how it works, and how to use
it.
